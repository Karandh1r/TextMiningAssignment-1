tt5918982,"Tasya Vos (Andrea Riseborough) is the Possessor. She's a corporate assassin who uses a brain implant to take over other people to do the killing. Her boss is Girder (Jennifer Jason Leigh). Her next take-over target is Colin Tate (Christopher Abbott) who is dating Ava Parse (Tuppence Middleton), the daughter of tech tycoon John Parse (Sean Bean).",negative
tt5918982,"Some artful notions swirling around in this one, ""Possessor,"" but not necessarily always amounting to much. A conclusion of a loss of empathy seems especially trite to me. There's so much more potential here than some character arch. More than the satire on the real world, too.",negative
tt5918982,"This should be retitled,""Too Much but also not enough"". There are so many ideas pulling the movie in so many different directions. It's ideas the movie, but rarely does an idea get fully realized here. This has me torn on how I feel. On one hand, there is a unique tone to this. It's like Assassin's Creed meets inception. People possessing other people's bodies to preform hits on specific people for political or social gain is a solid premise on it's own. Throw in some great ultra violent gore effects, good performances, and some moody, atmospheric music and you get some really striking scenes. On the other hand, the movie is overly ambitious. There's so much it establishes there's no way it can accomplish it all, and it doesn't. This is exemplified in the first act which feels horribly rushed. We get less then 20 minutes establishing characters, premise, and themes. It feels like it can't wait to move through the set up and what results is a lack of investment from me. We hardly know who anyone is or why they are doing anything. The main character is having a psychological melt down as a result from over working inside this possessor machine but she only takes like a half day off to recover. Then she's right back to work. There's barely motivation for this and in her half day off all she does is sit around at home with her ex. You needed more scenes explaining to us what lead to her breaking up with him and more establishment of why she would want to go back to him. We don't know these people or their story and we leave them so quickly it's hard to care about them at all. We literally get one scene of her away from her work, and it's nothing out of the ordinary as far as normal day goes. Why is she a workaholic? Her home life seems fine to me. Why won't she tell her superiors that she's having a mental breakdown? Is it supposed to be a metaphor about her dependency on work to avoid her real life? If that's the case then why don't we get more scenes showing why she would be avoiding her life? It's a messy movie, full of vague characters and even murkier story progression. Even though the first act is rushed, at least it sets some interesting things up. The second act is where the movie really faulters though. It feels like the same scenes happening over and over again. It gets really tedious watching a character saying the possessed person is acting weird over and over. There are some cool, trippy, drug like sequences showing the main character having more internal breakdowns but I got the point after the first time. Yeah she's not stable enough to be in there and the longer she is, the worse it will get. I get it. We don't need to see it 27 times. This is weird because the first act has the exact opposite problem. Like Inception these people are trying to accomplish something by manipulating others for their gain. Unlike Inception, where the first half of the movie is establishing characters, story motivations, and potential speed bumps, Possessor only seems interested in establishing the story speed bumps. We don't get a clear sense of character motivation or why the story is happening in the first place. This possessor company wants to own this large tech company? But why? Who knows! The real story is about the Possessor and the Possessy who go to war over who should have control over the body. So why even mention that they want to absorb this tech company? Instead, say that she needs to kill these people just because they are evil or corrupt. That wouldn't change what the movie is going for and it would clean up the story a bit. The whole point is the struggle between the possessed dude and the possessor and coming to terms with the horrible things that happened. It's kinda like watching someone with split personality disorder. Which, again, is an idea that could've and should've been fleshed out. It only comes up near the end and is wrapped up so quickly I don't know why they even bothered. The first act is completely rushed, the second act is drawn out to no end, and the third act introduces more things it can't quite pull off. So...eh?",neutral
tt5918982,"The same thing always happens. A movie gets hyped, I buy in and get excited, then watch it and am mildly interested in it and wonder what all the fervor was all about. It happened all over again with Possessor (or Possessor Uncut), which is not the alternate title to Horror Express (Â©Bill Van Ryn for that joke) and it's not one of the movies within a movie within Popcorn.",neutral

Possessor has some great performances and nice visual choices, the body horror bits do not disappoint as well and I thought the narrative was engaging from start to finish, found no issues with the pacing whatsoever.",positive
tt5918982,"One of the greatest directors from the 70s forward who put forth the idea of science fiction with body modification and manipulation was David Cronenberg. Imagine being the son of Cronenberg and having to live up to his record of films. It appears that his son Brandon is doing just that and succeeding. His latest film does just that and more, creating a science fiction premise that is frightening and fascinating at the same time.",positive

tt5918982,Opens really well and sets the scene well. Then rapidly descends into a poor gorefest that has no actual story. The performances are good but there is no empathy felt for the main character. Visually it's ok but nothing special. Too many buts for me. Meh,negative

tt5918982,"I enjoyed the shock value moments, but that can't be all there is. It's an interesting premise but it goes almost nowhere. They only take it in one direction but that's more than an hour into the movie. It's well made from a technical perspective, but it had trouble keeping me invested and i felt bored and unsatisfied (1 viewing, 4/8/2021)",negative
tt5918982,An interesting if not totally pointless premise leads to an interesting if not totally pointless story. At first it's interesting but then stops on one character for the entirety of the movie. This isn't good because it wastes the very notion set up by the premise. We could have had multiple characters undergoing this process yet instead we are left with what turns into a fairly pedestrian affair.,neutral
tt5918982,"... that's pretty much it. It just looks good. Well, the acting is alright too, i guess. The pacing is way too slow, literally 2/3 could've been cut into a 12 minutes run time. Though the concept is nice, they didn't able to make an interesting plot (if even there's any plot at all). The ""weird imagery"" and ""violent"" that sole purpose to make it edgy-artsy, didn't work. It ended up boring and dull.",neutral
tt5918982,"Similar in ways to existenz and videodrome themes. Really been missing David Cronenberg as he hasnt made many movies recently, so glad to see his sons taken over. His films are getting much better, this one being my favourite by miles so far. Excellent use of London set, nice camera work and its a real gorefest. It doesnt hold back in that respect, and some of the visual dream sequences were 1st class. Its not a perfect film by any means but has a number of strengths that horror film fans will appreciate.",positive
tt5918982,"I had heard great things about Possessor Uncut and eagerly looked forward to watching it. This British/Canadian science fiction/horror is the most brutal movie that I have seen for a while and knocks spots off the vast majority of today's offerings. Directed by Brandon Cronenberg, he certainly is a chip off the old block (David). I have to admit that the plot is not always to follow, I am sure that repeat viewings would help make things clearer (alternatively read a full synopsis). The violence and gore is extreme, plus there are a few scenes of very strong sex and nudity. The sets and locations look good and the acting is excellent. I found the movie impressive and look forward to watching it again, however this is most certainly not a film for everyone.",neutral
tt5918982,"It is almost as if, with the advent of streaming media, the critics are desperate for an actual feature to gush over. They picked the wrong movie. There are clever bits here and there, but the directors endless love affair with the tropes of low-budget film making, static scenes, dim lighting -- all these will ultimately disappoint. And the gushers would do well to remember that the director's father may have started with low-budget productions but eventually graduated to blockbusters like A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE. We can only hope.",negative
tt5918982,"The son of David Cronenberg wants to to a movie like Existenz, but he ultimately fails to do so. The acting is good, but the plot is really drawn out and says almost nothing in the end. Also, as many others noted, there is some gratuitous gore and violence put in which doesn't really advance the story in any way, and that extends to some other things as well.",negative
tt5918982,"Visually good, in some places great.",positive
tt5918982,"This one is slow with very few violent scenes, nudity n sex.
A contract killer is able to implant her consciousness into the body of another person in order to carry out an assassination. The assassin is able to control the body of another person but is not able to control the minds of others. A big lol.
It has a wierd sex scene n bloody stabbings but gets tedious.",negative
tt5918982,I really anticipated this movie but I was let down after watching it. 5 stars for the acting. That's it.,neutral
tt5918982,"With its good performances, excellent visual design, and all the blood and gore you could ask for, Brandon Cronenberg's 'Possessor' is a thrilling, engaging experience that succeeds in getting under your skin.",positive
tt5918982,"I hate watching films with expectations because they will undoubtedly influence perception/opinion. I admit I did go into this film with some hope that perhaps the young Cronenberg could live up to the family name in terms of cinematic experience to some degree. I at least hoped that it would be a reasonably good film, my expectations were definitely not all that high. I saw some good reviews, but didn't read them and just went to check it out with an open mind and a little hope. My hopes were unfounded as the film really is nothing to be excited about. In fact, I found the film to be profoundly boring. The story isn't bad really, it's somewhat interesting, but it's delivered in slow motion and with a lot of misplaced weirdness. This coming from a lover of weird films. Luis BuÃ±uel, David Lynch and Federico Fellini are among my favorite all time filmmakers for instance. I've never been a fan of weirdness just for the sake of being weird however. Weirdness needs to be interesting, compelling to at least some degree, not completely pointless. This film seems to focus too much on its weirdness and less on the interesting aspects of the story, and to me, none of the weirdness was of any interest. Brandon may indeed one day be a director worth watching, however today is not the day. To me this film was not even in the same league as Father David's first feature Shivers. That film isn't great either, but even it kicks the crap out of this pile of boring.",neutral

tt5918982,"I enjoyed watching this film, it seemed to be low budget but I thought it was extremely well filmed. There were some really creative and interesting scenes I had never seen before, especially the consciousness transfer. I found it hard to connect with the characters because they were all unlikeable. The concept was cool and one that should be in more movies, by I definitely think the story could be told better with more likeable characters and a clear protagonist and antagonist.",positive
tt5918982,"Cronenberg Jr. had the right idea, and his visuals were stunning - albeit the gore borderline overboard-cheesy, but his writing was riddled with plot and technical issues, and the ending was disappointing, forgettable and not worth the runtime's wait. There were also far too many convoluted scenes as well as many long, unnecessary and dragged out ones. The acting, cinematography and score were decent. The pacing was horribly slow, that the 103 min runtime felt like 3+ hours. This film needed faster pacing, and to be cut down to about 80 mins, with more clarity in the writing - especially the ending. Maybe dad should've given the screenplay a once-over to avoid such amateur errors. It's a generous 6/10 from me.",negative
tt5918982,"I don't think this movie fully works, but I don't want to dismiss it completely. It's aggressively unpleasant for long stretches with a wildly unappealing main character and some unclarity about who's who for a while, but the main character has an emotional (or one might say emotionless) journey that's well built around unpleasantness and the unclarity actually feeds that some of that at the same time. I'm mixed on this, having never really engaged with it on any level while watching it, but having learned to appreciate it on a certain intellectual level as I considered it after it was over.",positive
tt5918982,"It is weird, gory and yet very boring. I just don't understand what is going on.",negative
tt5918982,"This movie is unsettling. To its credit, that is partially due to its commitment to the relentlessly bleak and bloody life of Tasya, a woman whose job is to use a strange machine that lets her inhabit other people's bodies to carry out violent assassinations. The film truly conveys the dread of an alternate universe where such a thing exists. The audience is in a strange position at the edge of the seat waiting to see how this woman and her overlords' missions go, yet also wondering if we should be hoping for their own demise given the immorality of their scheme. It doesn't help that Tasya herself seems perturbed about her own actions.",negative
tt5918982,"The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. You can see where Brandon Cronenberg got his inspiration from. Like his dad he has his own view of making movies. The story is interesting but I can't help it to think the movie could have been better. So for the writing Brandon Cronenberg did a good job, for the directing it could have been better. The acting was good and that from the entire cast. There are some brutal scenes but they fit good in the movie. Overal the movie is worth a watch, curious about his next movie though.",positive
tt5918982,"Featuring an insane premise that only a Cronenberg mind can conceive, Possessor is a visceral blend of cerebral sci-fi & stomach-churning body horror that's surreal, haunting & above all original. Bathing in blood, basking in violence n gore, and blatant in its depiction of corporate greed, the film is equal parts fascinating & equal parts frustrating.",negative

tt5918982,"I just found the whole movie wrong from the opening scene. The look was off, the pacing was slow, the sound track was tedious and slow panning shots... I simply detest slow panning shots with ambient music. It was an extremely drawn out affair, interjected with frantic disjointed scenes of of graphic violence and sex. I feel this movie was made more for the filmaker's entertainment than the audience. It could have ended (and really should have) twenty minutes sooner. Even though it was about 90 minutes, it felt so much longer to me. The ending was a mess but at that stage I was just happy it was over.",negative

tt5918982,"The Possessor (2020) we recently rented off Amazon Prime for $1.99. The storyline is primarily about a high profile agent who uses brain implant technology to get access to other people's bodies to conduct assassinations for high profile/paying clients. The more missions they conduct the more they deteriorate themselves putting the agency and tasks at risk as their own mental state crumbles due to the technology. This movie is directed by Brandon Cronenberg (Antiviral and son of David Cronenberg) in his second major motion picture. This picture stars Gabrielle Graham (Shadow of the Moon), Hanneke Talbot (Ready or Not), Jennifer Jason Leigh (Dolores Claiborne), Daniel Park (12 Monkeys) and Andrea Riseborough (Oblivion). First off, I love this movie. The kill scenes are often subtle in their execution but also very intense. The delivery of the debilitating factors of the technology is also well delivered in both the storytelling, special effects and acting. Everything about this movie is well thought out and executed. This is a very smart and entertaining film that is definitely worth your time. I'd score this a 8-8.5/10.",neutral
tt5918982,"Wow. Brandon Cronenberg has done it. After his debut film, Antiviral - an admirable, but not quite accomplished attempt at picking up where his father David left off - he has created a fully realized and fully original vision in POSSESSOR. Not only do the concepts and aesthetics meet Cronenberg standards, but the levels of brutalism and discomfort are SHOCKING - this might be more brutal than ANY movie that David Cronenberg ever made, yet it feels like it's made in a completely inspired manner and with genuine purpose.",neutral

However, when the end credits started rolling, I didn't find myself satisfied. As others here have stated before me, this movie has quite a lot of holes in its plot. How did nobody know about the bomb shelter before? Why didn't the heroine's father leave her proper instructions about her ""inheritance""? Then there are questions that come up at the end that the movie does not answer, such as the unmentioned fate of the heroine's brother, who simply disappears from the story. The performers do a pretty good job despite the weaknesses in the material, and the entire production looks okay despite a limited budget.

She's really out of place as big city DA ""Lauren Monroe"", so that's a casting fail, which is a problem since she's the lead. That and other plausibility problems take you out of important moments and make this a so-so storytelling when it could've and should've been worth an 8 or 9 rating. The whole production is analogous to doodoo covered with white icing - it looks good enough to eat but heaven help you if you do! For instance, the whole initial premise that her father barely if at all really briefed her on the terrible responsibility of her inheritance just because someone might be listening in is ludicrous. Fine, you can forgive that one maybe since it launches the story but it's followed by too many subsequent implausibilities you'd have to look past to really enjoy the story itself.

She does what she feels is needed to right a wrong. In this day and age. It seems like people are always looking to tear movies apart. At least this one had an ending. Lauren was trying to stay true to her on self-imposes convictions. Wanting to believe she had achieved what she had on her own. It's a story someone wrote. Not me or people watching the movie. Honestly. Plot holes no. A hard to believe story. Yes. But. That is why I watch movies. To be entertained and to escape life for a couple of hours.

tt7923220,"The only disappointing thing about Inheritance is the ratings it gets on IMDb. To me it's seriously underrated, but then again I'm used to it. It's not the first time that I completely disagree with the ratings, in fact there are a lot of movies with this score that I find very entertaining whilst other very highly rated movies are rather boring to watch. Inheritance has an interesting story, the suspense is building up during the entire movie, with good acting from Simon Pegg and Lily Collins, as well as the rest of the cast. It's one of those mystery movies you keep guessing what happened, one that you know there is something odd about it but you stay eager to find out. So no I really don't get what people don't like about this movie. Sometimes you can see a movie is going to suck after just watching a couple minutes, the amateurism just oozes from the beginning, but with Inheritance I immediatly had the opposite reaction after a couple minutes, you can clearly see the cinematography was going to be good, and a good story and acting made it just slightly more entertaining than a just normal 'good' movie. You can't really go wrong with this movie if you like mystery thrillers.",neutral
tt7923220,"If only this film had at least as good story as Simon Pegg performance was,now really his acting saved this film from being even bigger disaster and to me he stole every scene that he was in,Lilly Collins in other hand was way to unconvincing as our character,i mean she give solid performance but her character lacked depth and personality,story was also all over the place and mixture of funny moments and dramatic situations wasnt very good,ending and plot twists were also very uneffective and it felt like they wanted to shock viewers with every means neceserey,but they failed in end,cause they tried way to hard for this kind of film,Inheritance was a film worthy of watch just because of Pegg performance,rest of film was rather unorginized and off",positive

And then she has these thoughts while she's being transferred in an ambulance to the asylum I assume..

tt10886166,"I became an official voter for the Razzies in 2020, not long before the world was devastated by the coronavirus pandemic, and with cinemas being closed, it meant that the nominations for the Golden Raspberry Awards would include digital platform releases. This Polish film was one listed in the suggested films to be nominated for the awards, it was surrounded by a high amount of negativity and controversy, including for it to be removed from Netflix, so I watched it as soon as possible. Basically, during a meeting between the Torricelli Sicilian Mafia crime family and black-market dealers, Massimo Torricelli (Razzie nominated Michele Morrone) sees a beautiful woman on a beach. Moments later, Massimo and his father (Gianni Parisi), leader of the Sicilian Mafia family, are both shot by the dealers; Massimo survives while his father dies. Five years later, Massimo is now the leader of the Torricelli crime family. He is often urging to fulfil his sexual pleasure and can only be satisfied by women he hires to perform oral sex and other acts with him. In Warsaw, Laura Biel (Razzie nominated Anna-Maria Sieklucka), a beautiful sales director working in a luxurious hotel, is unhappy in her relationship with her boyfriend Martin (Mateusz Lasowski), and longing for sexual pleasure herself. Laura celebrates her 29th birthday in Italy, but after Martin embarrasses her, she goes for a walk and runs into Massimo, who kidnaps her. Laura finds herself being held captive at Massimo's villa. He reveals that she is the woman he saw on the beach when he was injured. He has been thinking about and searching for her for five years. Massimo tells Laura that he intends to keep her as a prisoner for 365 days until she falls in love with him. He also promises her that he will not touch her without her consent, whilst simultaneously having his hands around her throat and touching her. When Laura tries to escape, he does not let her leave. With no choice but to stay with him, she accepts and takes of advantage of the luxurious lifestyle. As they spend time together, Laura teases him and then refuses to have sex with him. However, she slowly starts to get him to open up about his personal life. At a hotel in Rome, she teases him again. Massimo cuffs her to the bed and forces her to watch him as he receives oral sex from another woman. Afterward, she appears to want to give in. But he releases her and orders her to get dressed for a night out. At the club, Massimo is angered as Laura flaunts herself in front of him and his friends. When she begins to flirt with a man from the rival mafia family, the man gropes her against her will. Massimo and the others draw their weapons while Laura is taken out of the club. The following morning, she wakes on a yacht to see Massimo and his fellow mafioso, Mario (Bronislaw Wroclawski), arguing. During the night, a mafia war between the two families has ignited, after Massimo shot the man who groped Laura in his hand. Laura attempts to apologise, but Massimo blames her for the incident. As they argue, Laura falls from the side into the water. Massimo jumps in and saves her. When she awakens, he admits he was scared she might not make it and does not want to lose her. Laura finally gives into her feelings and sexual desires, gives Massimo oral sex, before the proceed to make love on the bed, and numerous times in numerous positions in other places on the yacht. After a long time being incarcerated, Massimo allows Laura to visit her family in Warsaw. He tells her he loves her and will join her after finishing up business. In Warsaw, Laura waits for Massimo for days with no contact. She reconnects with her friend Olga (Magdalena Lamparska) and they go clubbing. At the club, she runs into Martin, who says he has been looking. He wants to apologise and reconcile. He follows her back to her apartment, where Massimo is unexpectedly waiting. After Martin leaves, they have sex, during which Laura sees wounds on Massimo's body, wounds from the mafia war. She confesses to him that she loves him. The next morning, Laura is surprised when Massimo proposes, to which she accepts. However, she tells him she wants him to keep his ""occupation"" a secret from her parents. Back in Italy, Mario informs Massimo of rising tensions. Laura mentions feeling unwell but decides not to see a doctor. They discuss their upcoming wedding, she does want her family to know what Massimo does, so they are not allowed to attend. However, Massimo allows Laura to invite Olga as her bridesmaid. When Olga visits, Laura tells her she is pregnant. Olga urges her to tell Massimo about the pregnancy. Meanwhile, Mario receives a phone call from an informant that the rival mafia family has threatened to kill Laura. Laura and Olga are driving through the hills, and Laura's car enters a tunnel but does not come out the other side. Mario rushes to find Massimo just as Laura's call to him is cut off. Massimo breaks down, as it is implied Laura is dead, with police gathering at the entrance of the tunnel. Also starring Otar Saralidze as Domenico, Natasza Urbanska as Anna, Grazyna Szapolowska as Klara Biel, Laura's mother, and Tomasz Stockinger as Tomasz Biel, Laura's father. Morrone is good looking and Sieklucka is beautiful, there is only a little chemistry between them, the morality of the situation is concerning. The film has 0% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, it is listed in the IMDb Bottom 100 list, and there is a petition to have it removed from Netflix. This is due to its sexual violence, and that it apparently is ""glorifying Stockholm Syndrome and abuse"". There was the slightest part of me that went along with it, being so ridiculous (I can see the comparison to Fifty Shades of Grey), the softcore porn style sex scenes and violence certainly get your attention, and maybe some songs in the soundtrack, but otherwise it is a dark and daft ""love"" story, a silly and unconvincing erotic romantic drama.

tt7126948,"This movie has some really bad points. It isn't the worst action hero movie ever. It's 80% bad with some redeeming qualities here and there.
Firstly the bad points:
1. The story. This silly ""wish"" premise is weak and wears thin very fast. Be careful for what you wish for. Even a 1984 movie wouldn't have such a simplistic premise. It gets too overblown at the end. The writers really did a bad job. It's beyond low mentality and cliched. And things really fizzle out at the climax.
2. Long winded scenes. Many scenes could have been cut in half to keep the momentum going. From the overlong competition in the beginning, almost every scene could have been trimmed by a quarter.
The good points:
1. Gal Gadot is watchable and likeable - she could read the phone book and it would be watchable.
2. Pedro Pascal of Narcos is the villain here and he looks quite different - good that he has a big movie role.
3. Kristen Wiig has a remarkable transformation and her character is quite interesting.
4. Watch out for Lynda Carter.
The cast is good but they can't save a bad story. Chris Pine looks a bit haggard.

The movie lost me when Steve was brought back... in another man's body. WHY. WHY? If the stone is so powerful, why couldn't it just manifest him as himself, instead of some poor dude who probably got fired for not showings up for days and got dumped by his girlfriend...etc. The way Diana and Steve just take over this person's apartment and life with no concern is strange, concerning, and completely out of character. There's so much more... Cheetah looking nothing like the comics, how much damage she was able to do to supposedly indestructible armor, no explanation of if the ENTIRE POPULATION OF THE WORLD would remember the events of this movie and if not, why/how...

For the action, the effects are good, not worth the time to watch, but still well made, but there are not very much action scenes.

A super villian she's not, even for comic relief. And where is the strong empowered woman that encourages other women to use their own powers? Then there is that magic lasso, Diana might just as well sat and her desk in the museum and flicked it to and fro since it appeared to have an infinite length this time around. Placing the film in her memories of the '80s this might work for Coppola or Scorsese but one's sense of history needs to be able to look further into the past to develop a view. Was that President supposed to be Reagan, surely you could have found someone who actually resembled him. So much for '80s memories. The scenes of an injured and defeated WW were way to drawn out, and the computers of the day were only beginning to go beyond pixelated pictures. The technology of the day would not have been able to broadcast to the world. And Gal Gadots talents were never realized she just wasn't involved enough beyond window dressing, more attention was spent on the sets and locations. And what disappointment the release streaming and theatre distribution. Although I love theaters (I spent 35 yrsin the movie business) where I live they haven't reopened yet.

It's filled with them and you just have to roll your eyes. Superman v. Batman is far more superior than this film. Director Patty Jenkins really dropped the ball. The first film was so much better. What blows my mind is that the movie was directed by the same person who directed the first one. I think it was the right decision to split the release between digital and theatrical because it was not going to make its profit back just by doing a theatrical release, let alone on demand. I don't recommend this movie. I'd advise you wait until it's free on tv in about a year. It's that bad. It pains me to be so critical of Wonder Woman because I'm a huge fan. However, I'm not a fan of a director who can't even make a decent sequel. This is the same director who is going to direct Star Wars Rouge Squadron in 2023.

The WW in this movie represents and displays all of the stereotypical cliches so many serious actresses have worked for years to dispel. In the first WW she was a badass who fought with passion against evil and stood up for her convictions. In WW84, when she's not pining for her lost love (because we all know a woman is lost without her man, right?) she's winking at little kids while she fights campy bad guys who are literally tripping over themselves to get caught. The female supporting cast isn't much better. Kristen Wiig is the embodiment of the frazzled, clingy stereotype that went out of style in most movies years ago. The only 2 strong women (Connie Nielsen amd Robin Wright) are gone after the first 10 minutes and we are left with weak, campy garbage. The WW in the first film was Christian Bale's Batman.

This lacked all of that and it tries so hard to be emotional but still fails. I had to watch this in three separate days because I kept falling asleep. The villain is dorky and cliche, the relationships and ""touchy"" moments didn't move me at all and I'm an emotional kinda guy. 1.5 hours into the film, only two very brief action scenes take place in which they were very frustrating to watch and the rest is boring dialog and bad character development with cliche characters to top it off.

tt7126948,"'Wonder Woman 1984 (2020)' suffers from similar issues as its predecessor. It doesn't make a good first impression, as its opening is honestly pretty rough. Though its initial action scene has a few enjoyable moments, the first sequence that properly showcases the eponymous hero is really unconvincing and is possibly the worst one in the entire affair. Thankfully, then, the second act is considerably better than the first. Once again, a decent chunk of the film is solidly entertaining. It's a little slow (people who prefer to see Diana in her costume might be a bit disappointed), but it's perfectly fine and features quite a few compelling scenes. Perhaps surprisingly, its best elements are its characters and theme. Though it's often heavy-handed, the flick does a good job of exploring its interesting central concept, which is actually rather resonant and gives its characters something to struggle with internally. Pedro Pascal and Kristen Wiig are probably the movie's best aspects; their characters are distinct, unexpected and surprisingly believable. Pascal, especially, is a delight to watch as a charming but greedy businessman whose initially calm exterior slowly breaks down over the course of the story. Unlike its predecessor, the movie manages to successfully - and, I'll add, satisfyingly - see its theme through to its logical conclusion. Unfortunately, the film's quality drops significantly as it moves into its final act. After a fairly forced heel turn, the affair struggles to balance its human (though still overblown) stakes with its superhero action. It feels as though the final, CGI-fuelled fight is only included out of a pressure to confirm to the genre. The finale's actual conclusion brings things back down to a more relatable level, but by then most of the damage is done. Still, it's not a terrible sequence and its conclusion is actually shockingly effective. What isn't shockingly effective is the picture's denouement. This tacked-on ending (clearly a reshoot added due to the piece's pushed-back December release) is genuinely terrible, a Hallmark-esque moment that straight-up seems like a life-affirming commercial for, like, a beer or something. It's so bad that it almost sours the entire feature; you really have to remind yourself that this scene doesn't represent the quality of the overall thing. I mean, there are a few sequences that look, sound and, even, feel 'made for TV' (and one that annoyingly uses John Murphy's theme from 'Sunshine (2007)'), but nothing comes close to the cringe of the last pre-credits scene. So, overall, the film is a mixed bag. It does some things better than its predecessor, such as maintain a consistent theme and provide compelling villains, but it also does some things much worse and, even at its best, generally isn't as entertaining. However, it's not a bad picture, by any means. Frankly, some of the heavy criticism levelled towards is a bit excessive. 6/10.",neutral

While both villains are ridiculous, the idea of Diana's dead lover possessing another man was even much worse! Script is not only cheesy as the worst clichÃ© romantic comedies, but also quite lazy, as the evil rock of desires makes obvious. Cheetah's uprising, the invisible plane... everything had a bad and unintelligent explanation in the story, or simply was not explained, such as the weird flight (was that Supergirl?!

The CGI is really bad in some places, and the action sequences are also stale and boring. This film does nothing to set up any future stories within the DCEU, or really shed any light on WW, other than the opening scene showing her as a child.
The worst part of all has to be the ending. Max Lord has to touch people to grant wishes, but at the end all he has to do is appear on TV? What!? Also, to break the wishes he granted, all a person has to do is renounce the wish. So in the end, WW really isn't needed at all.",negative

tt7126948,I was really looking forward to this film. Unfortunately this script was poorly executed and written so the sequel falls short. Villains are one dimensional and it is slow and mushy almost like a drama romance with such a trite story/plot that by the short amount of action starts in bits of pieces it's almost forced and feels odd against villains that really do not pose any threat. So many cliches and huge holes in the story and characters that WWoman focuses more in her compassion and empathy than on actually why she is really in 80s reality. And Kristen Wiig character Dr Poison is yet another twisted lost persona/villain that is interesting yet confusing what is her role like many others like Maxwell Lord you never feel is a real villain at all yet WWoman wants to stop him from ... laughable threat of getting people to stop asking for wishes. It's such a terrible story that even by the last Act when the real positive message comes forth it feels like forced conjecture and more cliche antics. It's shocking that a script could be green lit with so many disconnected parts that just don't work. I honestly don't know who these people are claiming it's a masterpiece but it's definitely not even remotely close to being as good as the last one. I'm giving it a 1 Star because my friends walked out of the film and that's pretty rare esp for solid DC fans. Better luck next time and please remember it's an action film not a feel good drama romance. And enough with the silly shoe and change of clothing scenes. What's next..

tt10344522,"Tragic circumstances lead to recalibration of words we can take for granted. Normally, we might think of a ""good"" day as one filled with friends, family, food, and fun. But families battered by the broken promises and crushing disappointments of substance abuse may find that for them a ""good"" day determined not by what it contains but by what it does not. In ""Four Good Days,"" based on a true story, a young addict must not use drugs for four days to receive a promising treatment. ""Good,"" for her and perhaps even more for her mother, means abstaining from drugs. The word ""love"" may not get re-calibrated for addiction, but it gets modified. We speak of ""tough love."" And so, when Molly (Mila Kunis), a strung-out addict who has been through rehab and relapsed more than a dozen times, shows up at her mother's house, instead of a warm welcome, she is turned away. Molly's mother Deb (Glenn Close) leans out of the door, her stillness in contrast to Molly's hopped-up shifts of tone. She has been lied to so much and stolen from so often she believes that it is best for Molly if those around her can impose firm boundaries. But Deb wants so badly to believe her. ""Whenever I've decided to engage with her it's always been with my eyes open,"" she says. But hope always pushes to try again, even when experience has shown us it will only break our heart. To the searing pain of the addiction/self-loathing hamster wheel, where ""life is a trigger"" and it seems the only way to bear the pain and loss and shame of addiction is to keep getting high. Drugs ruin lifes, and relationships, the only thing to do is surround yourself with people that support you, and love you. Family is the only thing that means a goddamn, you'll learn that. You've always got a reason! But it's always someone's else's fault!? At some point in your life, you are going to have to take responsibility.",negative

tt10344522,"I have read a lot of these reviews and I just wanted to add my opinion. Not all addicts are the same. What works for one might not work for another. But as a former user of opioids, I want to say that Subutex (buprenorphine) is a life saver. If only it was more accessible to addicts, so many lives would be saved. One pill can keep you from getting high for 72 hours and it can also take away the unbelievable pain addicts experience when withdrawing from narcotics. It is also much safer than something like methadone. Unfortunately, it can be hard to find a doctor that is licensed to provide this medication and it can be expensive. But I have been on it now for quite some time and it has kept me from relapsing. I'm not saying I don't have cravings. But taking the Subutex every day makes it impossible to get high even if I did slip up. One more thing I wanted to add. Opioid addiction can cause bad teeth just like meth addiction can. When you're too high to take care of your oral hygiene, it doesn't really matter which drug made you that way.",neutral

I got sober at 18...almost 19. My mother and I today are so amazing but I still sometimes look at her and have to stop myself from tearing up. I put her into actual living hell. I'm 40 years old now.

tt10344522,"'Four good days' is nothing if not a vehicle for Mila Kunis and Glenn Close. Whatever the size or tone of the parts, both are incredible actors and have demonstrated their skills time and again. This is easily the least glamorous role Kunis has ever taken on, and Close has likewise had few roles that seemed so down to earth. Both wield strong nuance and depth in their performances, realizing Molly and Deb with every ounce of emotion and range they possess. It's a joy to watch them here, and gratifyingly, they dominate the screen at almost all times. To that point, commendations as well to the makeup, hair, and wardrobe departments for their fine work in actualizing these characters.",positive
tt10344522,"Although the actress is portraying a very bad side of addiction reviewers need to remember this is after 10 years of heavy use. Other reviews on here are wrong she wasn't just on opioids,...she did all sorts of drugs. So no, this doesn't just represent opioid addiction. This movie is a perfect example of how easy it is to go from a prescription or small weekend habit that ""helps"" you through your day to, throwing your entire life away trying and doing anything to get high. Sure some addicts aren't as bad off and have more control to the point you'd never even know they were an addict. However, the point of this movie is to show all of the extremely dark sides of addiction and how addiction starts. They did a good job showing the multiple factors that can play a role in addiction like, doctors who carelessly give these drugs out, how your mental health can make it a struggle to stay sober, and how family traumas truly can cause someone to go down a very bad path. Most importantly they show how much you can lose and how hard it is to get clean again. Not to mention how hard is will be to regain trust from those you crossed in active addiction. I see people making remarks about her appearance in the movie not being accurate compared to her main drug of choice. I strongly disagree. I watched friends loose their teeth in a matter of 4 years from pain pill use alone. They had poor hygiene and didn't ever eat leading to vitamin deficiency. That's why withdrawals can be so painful the drug masks the feeling of pain but once you come off not only are your receptors out of wack but your entire body is in excruciating pain from not taking care of yourself. Addiction looks different for everyone . This movie is not an every case scenario but like I said it does show what most severe cases look like. Why do you think so many people end up on the streets from drugs? You can't tell me ALL of those people have noone in their life that would help if they were good honest people. Most likely their family/friends have tried and time and time again to save them. All while they lie scheme and steal from you. Sometimes people have no choice but to turn their back until they get clean and become the good person they once were. They also show how difficult it is to get treatment. Overall, in a world like today this is a great movie for anyone who has struggled with addiction or currently struggling. Children can even benefit from this movie as long as it's followed with a serious talk at the end where the discussion is open for any questions they may have. Children need to be made aware of these things before they are teenagers. Its way too easy to get your hands on drugs and become addicted. Most of the time the parent doesn't know until it's too late and their child is gone whether it's physically or metaphorically. Addiction is a terrible disease.",neutral

The distinction between his reality and the reveries that make up his daily existence sort of blend together in a way that confound the senses. Hopkins is extraordinary in the role, and if this is his last chance to earn an Oscar for Best Actor, then it's a darn good one in a field with some significant competition. Olivia Colman as Anthony's struggling daughter expresses all the concern and frustration that comes with being the primary caregiver for her dementia stricken father, and there are somber moments in the picture when you want to cry along with her over the hopelessness of both his and her situation. As a harbinger of what might happen to anyone as we all approach those senior twilight years, the film can be a depressing experience, only somewhat mitigated by the care and concern that dedicated health care workers are able to provide in an institutional setting.

His mind deteriorates, and reality stops making any sense. This movie will haunt you, especially if you have a relative with dementia. Such a heartbreaking movie. ABSOLUTELY the best movie of the year and the best performance of the year by Hopkins.",neutral
tt10272386,"The Father couldn't be more realistic when talking about Alzheimer's disease. I've seen my grandfather walking that path. He was a smart man but once the dementia kicked in he was barely recognizable, which was a hard thing to witness when you knew him as the intellectual he was. The Father just nailed this subject, bringing back so many memories, memories we would rather forget but that you can't. Living with a loved one with this disease isn't easy at all, certainly not when that person sometimes doesn't remember who you are. I didn't knew Anthony Hopkins won an Oscar for his role, but after watching this movie I can only say it's highly deserved. It's probably one of his better performances ever, and that at 83 years old. The Father isn't a movie that will give you a lot of joy, it's sad and scary but certainly worth watching. Nobody wants to have a loved one suffering from dementia, it's a nightmare to live with. I remember my grandfather starting to smoke a cigarette like it was a thing he always did and that whilst he stopped more than forty years ago. I remember him telling me he was going crazy after asking me the same question for the twentieth time in barely an hour. He knew it was all going downhill, he knew he was a burden to everybody, and that must hurt when you are still that little bit lucid to understand that. I watched several movies about dementia but this one is just the most realistic. It's sad but that's life, everybody should watch it so they can be prepared if the disease ever would hit a loved one.",neutral
tt10272386,"This is the kind of movie that may feel you uncomfortable, it is disturbing but that will make you stuck to the screen. It shows the kind of situation that may concern millions of us, now or in the future, or also in the past, about one of our relatives. Of course Anthony Hopkins gives a more than brilliant performance and the most unusual is to lead the audience in some kind of a maze, the audience who can have the feeling to be tricked. Anyway, I warn some audiences against this beautiful and powerful stage movie, some audiences who could have a father or mother suffering of Alzheimer disease. It could be very painful to watch. But there were many other movies speaking of this. However this one has something special, I have not yet found excatly what. I derseves to be seen again. And again, especially if you lose memory....",neutral
tt10272386,Wow. This story is expertly crafted that I just don't know what is real and what isn't. Amazing acting too.,positive
tt10272386,"One of my all time favorite movies is Charlie Kaufman's Synecdoche, New York which narrates the ever deteriorating world around a playwright bordering on reality and insanity. And Florian Zeller's The Father is the closest I've seen that captures the insanity of the decaying mind, but told through the apparatus of a very real and universal issue.",negative

This puts you in the shoes of a man whose mind is deteriorating. I fully recommend that everyone see this movie. As great as it is, it is not one I want to rewatch anytime soon.",neutral
