tt0468569,hyped movie year probably one hyped movies ever even overhype see heath ledger play joker trailers looked awesome finally paid ticket watched movie
tt0468569,heath ledger christian bale absolutely phenomenal movie
tt0468569,whatever else may the dark knight christopher nolans follow batman begins film resurrected batman franchise ambitious superhero film ever made full brooding ruminations inherent nature humanity obviously fueled troubled state world packs awful lot plot two-and-a-half-hour running time however cautioned let rating imdb set expectations film cant possibly meet doubt experienced film goer truly going think best film ever made
tt0468569,remember sayings magazines critics would say? one popular ones was: if see one movie summer it well never understood well really really dark knight movie plain say dark knight far greatest entertaining movie released year period
tt0468569,know im supposed dislike movie like especially since heath ledger acts well ive seen film several times ive given due honestly good direction acting amazing plot bad plot outrageous though joker could accomplish even part insane even comics phone call scene u fing kidding outlandish annoying ferries !!! common know fantasy whole social experiment stupid arggg hate film nolan amazing job honestly burton runs laps vision plot sub par point annoyance know everyone loved film honestly badreally bad hard pass

tt0071562,the godfather part ii excellent like predecessor first arguably greatest film ever made second installment easily best sequel produced hands film split stories michael corleone (al pacino oscar-nominated) young vito corleone (robert de niro star-making first oscar-winning performance) michael trying expand crime empire locales las vegas hollywood even turbulent cuba however numerous problems older brother fredo (john cazale) may double-crossed family also two prominent crime bosses pose considerable threat well (lee strasberg michael v ga o oscar-nominated) younger sister connie (oscar nominee talia shire) still reeling husbands murder fathers death conclusion original film michael also distancing wife (diane keaton) trusted friends (robert duvall) occurring get glimpses early life michaels father (de niro) learn parents older brother killed sicily immigrated new york vito pays dues learns tricks trade buying time deciding create small empire would course grow become saw original would seem film would confusing jumping back forth michael father coppola gives enough information keep audience intrigued segment film well-made runs smoothly even though lasts minutes many think installment best series even though still think original best cannot totally disagree assertion definitive sequel stars
tt0071562,one time greats probably alone greatest thing ever made history cinematography movie prequel sequel first godfather movie never watched anything like entire life movie explained life underworld people great way also shows vengeance eradicates happiness life people even care family greed power masterpiece never written even centuries even kind movies suggest watch atleast life deprived one greatest things watch ever made
tt0071562,original godfather brilliant work sense voyeuristic delight allowing us see mafia inside - become part family single-handedly change worlds view organized crime created cast sympathetic characters none shred common morality highest grossing movie time brando created cultural icon whose influence resonates strong today
tt0071562,sequel terrific first film hesitate call sequel sequel quite simply wrong word looking film like the matrix reloaded sequel - the godfather part ii something good called sequel
