tt8503618,one critic recently wrote list three great musicals must seen stage hamilton one
tt8503618,musical based life alexander hamilton one founding fathers
tt8503618,seen play loving set disappointment chance one limitation confined screen portraya extremely well done minimum close-ups filming staging worked well sound good words lost since original cast got see thing best leave others get plot details intrigued beginning end
tt8503618,like rest world watched hamilton disney plus weekend though seen number stage musicals seen hamilton yet first opportunity see highly regarded show say disappoint
tt8503618,fortunate enough see hamilton times chicago including second row thanks friend winning lottery compare? way better expected honestly noticed new moments saw original cast new light experienced story like onstage theres nothing quite like theater may closest film crew ever got capturing theater magic (i wish rent movie recording production) hamilton represents unique moment american theatre im grateful someone captured
tt8503618,yesterday bazillion folks tuned disney see debut hamiltona recording broadway show back traditional movie-style musical pretty difficult compare typical film genre also film whose enjoyment definitely depends age age like hip-hop style music musical despite respect show trying accomplish--to bring america history masses make accessible minorities parts played black hispanic actors actresses likes george washington aaron burr played black actors historically accurate help make history inclusiveas modern music ex-history teacher thrilled things even fond singing well worth seeingand nice chance publicize nearly forgotten great americans
tt8503618,hamilton biography - drama musical watch life story one founding fathers first secretary treasury alexander hamilton learn work life
tt8503618,thought ive heard read musical phenomenon july would appropriate evening judge im pleased say hype hamilton true truly fabulous stage show
tt8503618,exciting thing like people heard hamilton was/is huge phenomenon broadway launched careers incredible people miranda always fun quirky goofy musical wizard pops shows leslie odom jr always impishly wicked energy oh lets forget daveed diggs comer blindspotting couple things would watch anything unfortunately live light years away decent stage odds seeing real life seemed like something may never happen enter magical world disney given opportunity finally experience phenomenon albeit original form course build hype worried possibly measure
tt8503618,"ive loved hamilton since music first became available itunes must listened almost every song thousand times getting watch impeccable exquisite awesome original cast wow! people gave low ratings made part first act like suggest: stay act (wait it) first act youthful explosive revolutionary energy second act lot variety songs - may make cry plus see act totally miss daveed diggs hilarious winning performance jefferson (i love daveed diggs is) look historical inaccuracies way: yes f fathers terrible s--t ) musical perhaps largely ideals - also maybe get turned back-room deals (the room happens) mistake characters written exacting portrayals actual men large awful men - wish cast f fathers :)
so let musical musically lyrically acting-wise breathtaking one (wonderful) show enjoy asking see many times want"
tt8503618,although many musical adaptations flopped may proved best way simply film play get one best musicals available watch whenever like affordable price great work everyone involved especially lin manuel miranda
tt8503618,"review:
hamilton broadway musical filmed tv music lyrics lin-manuel miranda tells story american founding father alexander hamilton shows music draws heavily hip hop well r&b pop soul traditional-style show tunes
ive heard broadway musical years located small town way would able see show heard coming disney excited nervous due fact sure would victim overhype im happy able say true masterpiece show make want revisit again
the show casts non-white actors founding fathers historical figures truly brilliant showcases actors talents makes stand racial stereotypes xenophobia amazing heartbreaking watching actors big stage brilliant way move remember lines three-hour long event stage shows actors underappreciated form art storytelling everybody show perfect job one actor seemed blast role played two completely different character perfectly daveed diggs
aside incredible story lost founding father alexander hamilton show brilliant soundtrack seamless transitions scenes keeps eyes glued screen want show end super limited space production design able showcase different parts world united states different dress codes props done ease
overall urging everybody watch amazing piece art fan musicals love biggest fan musicals truly believe music show alone keep engage intrigued story"
tt8503618,fan musicals cant bear listening songs minutes without dialogues film everything expressed songs listen talking without rhythm songs (yes read right) hour mins runtime like musicals songs definite genre comprises ja rap hip-hop acapella soft songs many since musicals limited audience gain much popularity pity films like extraction days get much hype whereas great work like goes unnoticed
tt8503618,really enjoy hamilton soundtrack excited actually view performance! however sense think listened soundtrack much point know happens well watching musical recommend over-saturating oneself hamilton media
tt8503618,movie stage show excellent lot reasons cast lot every cast member makes role real memorable smoothly earn massive applause receive number easy see
tt8503618,know little bit americas founding fathers lot really taught uk thats important though knowing history enjoy mean americas independence musicals thing either certainly musical theatre several exclamation points theatre production filmed fairly simply camera angles covering stage mostly wide show lovely set occasional close well provide variation edit nothing thing show designed enjoyed room theres set camera positions camera normally eye seat thats possible right though exists film works though undeniably spectacle like singing dancing might think buggered honestly though pretty top quality singing dancing safe hands fast fun energy dialled way mix humour hip hop show tunes make even hardened cynic smile alright gimmicky actors spitting bars wearing frock-coats declaring war guess rules different theatre effective film often said actors look like theyre much fun audience think applies either everybody looks time lives live audience hear see seem pretty lengthy theres lot least pretty eventful life story alexander hamilton rags revolutionary social climbing agitator love writing setting financial institutions weddings duals adultery bribery bloody big war lot political manoeuvring historical content top line stuff covering basics theyre touch points really never allowing story get dry manages without dumbing much razor sharp humour helps immigrants get job done cast wonderful daveed diggs lafayette jefferson standout quieter moments theres sequences one bombastic banger another canon fire scratching score gets pretty raucous went little trepidation lin-manuel miranda indeed created something marvellous spine-tinglingly brilliant might stop saying like musicals
tt8503618,ill cut chase filmed version mega-hit stage musical hamilton (now streaming disney ) terrific one seen check - glad
tt8503618,waiting long long time see this! definitely let down!
tt8332922,cannot believe number people claiming movie first ridiculous! wonder whether saw quiet place part saw obviously follows similar themes builds story develops characters give writer/producer/director actor john krasinski delivered sequel really enhances story introduced part time played much broader canvas
tt8332922,although aqpii bad look like attempt cash theres problems storyline overall difference first film:
tt8332922,brief flashback day film picks part left newly widowed evelyn tiptoeing away burning house kids deaf regan marcus strangely silent baby baby fall emmett regan wants take squealing hearing aid island redio transmitter order mess critters hearing
tt8332922,othing else im primarily impressed films seem like cinematic franchise built raptors kitchen sequence jurassic park rare sequel least equal came reminded much missed going movies
tt8332922,othing makes logical sense sequel like first one
tt8332922,movie ended left distinct feeling must missed something quite place part ii seemed exact film part albeit new characters added cast
tt8332922,liked story begins whole invasion began spent time matter fact worldwide view humanity failed invasion instead get story times makes wonder missed something (on pier especially) also son appears gotten stupid since first movie ending rather contrived periods silence movie style showing two three parts story intermingled get aware director doing something weakens film ending contrived thinksay whattttt characters decisions movie make many plot holes actions original something question sequel get daughters discovery believe one else figured matter wondered type creature create fly spaceship multiply here? kicked planet like alien nation? creatures seem intelligence organization government like dinosaurs figured build spaceship fly space movie grossed million unnecessary sequel watch movie called earth vs flying saucers see discovery kill monsters
tt8332922,liked much first one suspenseful parts slow parts main gripe movies characters act certain situations scratch head thinking way would anyway quick action thriller worth watch fan first one
tt8332922,always say opening scene/sequence film crucial even horror movie title card day pops beginning a quiet place part know treat truly great sequence im normally huge proponent jump-scares however first one movie absolutely got im rarely gotten sequence sets tone film masterfully everything else flows
tt8332922,first one definitely better good cillian murphy perfect edition cast think itd work without john krasinski definitely wrong glad theres third one announced id hated ending wise think far horror films go best best theres none like like nearly good
tt8332922,good sequel rarity!
tt8332922,replace krasinski cillian murphy movie basically thing maybe bit less surprising fresh; could watch back back would feel like extension movie found rooting murphys character got acquainted
tt8332922,enjoyed first one certainly enjoy one
tt8332922,plot suspense thrills drama would translated noise film indeed awfully quiet place
tt8332922,people think good movie well better first movie adds knowledge going writing thing better first movie adds lore minimizes stupid cgi expands storytelling us recommend
tt8332922,premise still blind monsters somehow defeated human race although kill shotgun hitting metal bar
tt8332922,good: film well made - everything cinematography lighting sound action pacing etc big props course acting leads (including younger actors) excellent also like way passing torch shot - clearly defined parallels drawn make easy see directors visio
tt8332922,second installment a quiet place ii one anticipated delayed films due pandemic sequel level predecessor arranges story linearly keeps viewer constant tension short minutes
tt8332922,othing new learned nothing new happened ending almost identical absolute waste time
tt8332922,liked first part sure sequel well decent work acting direction story pacing everything good overall good watch enjoy
tt8332922,thoroughly disappointing continuation original story lost charm original lost sight made special quiet place anymore all; monsters incompetent less frightening pose none tension suspense original characters one dimensional lacklustre plot essentially one big mcguffin hunt really unfortunate think premise world offers still intriguing one could taken lots interesting directions movie offer hopefully future sequels better made theres good aspects (such backstory monsters; loved that) overall think plots weak spark gone
tt8332922,let count ways
tt8332922,excellent best horror flick years!!
tt8332922,firstly appreciate producers respected name movie kept quite possible thought movie quiet anymore watching trailer
tt8332922,original film brilliant scary movie one best ive seen last years excited sequel eventually released cinemas basically opens flashback beginning alien invasion abbott family attending baseball game marcus (noah jupe) playing mid-game spectators bewildered see flaming object sky hurtling towards earth people leave park try drive away town attacked alien creatures armoured skin high speed extraordinary strength father husband lee (john krasinski also writing directing) slowly realises creatures blind hypersensitive hearing hunt victims present day population wiped aliens lee killed sacrificing save children remaining family wife evelyn (emily blunt) adolescent marcus deaf teenage daughter regan (millicent simmonds) new-born baby son regan discovered high-frequency audio feedback weakness creatures found transmitting noise cochlear implant hearing aid microphone speaker makes creatures vulnerable allowing evelyn shoot dead isolated home fame destroyed finding method kill monsters family leave find refuge search survivors bring regans kit fend creatures enter fenced-off area trigger booby-trap forced run marcus steps bear trap subsequent screams attract creature regan uses kit weaken evelyn kills free marcus flee abandoned steel foundry another creature approaches inside stumble upon emmett (cillian murphy) former friend lees become recluse takes inside hide creature sound-proof area reluctantly allows stay bunker seeing baby protect baby avoid cries attracting attention creatures kept inside box containing breathing mask connected oxygen tank whilst hiding foundry marcus regan discover radio station signal continuously plays song beyond sea bobby darin regan determines clue meant lead survivors salvation group nearby islands theorises reach radio tower hearing aids high-frequency noise transmitted survivors weaponize creatures telling marcus plan secretly ventures alone find broadcast station discovering regan gone evelyn implores emmett bring back emmett finds regan exploring abandoned train containing corpses victims monsters averting creature attracted sound made locomotive emmett wants return foundry emmett initially sceptical plan find radio station theorising may survivors convinced regan sense duty help others meanwhile evelyn leaves marcus baby foundry gather needed medical supplies equipment including canisters oxygen absence marcus explores foundry discovers corpse emmetts wife startled knocks something creating sound alerts nearby creature marcus narrowly gets bunker accidentally locks baby inside breathable air oxygen remaining tank running marina emmett regan search boat ambushed feral people begin search regan supplies emmett shouts attract two creatures slaughter deranged inhabitants boarding vessel emmett sees one creature drown realises aliens cannot swim regan secures small boat two find island small colony survivors settled living relatively normal existence need silence colony leader (djimon hounsou) reveals government discovered creatures unable swim national guard moved many people possible islands meanwhile marcus baby still trapped air-tight bunker close suffocating evelyn returns distracts creatures using one two canisters collected ignite monster saving children three continue hiding inside bunker creature prowls foundry creature boarded yacht marina drifted island immediately begins attacking colonists colony leader emmett regan jump car lead creature radio station creature kills leader emmett regan make inside regan finds source signal creature comes attack creature kill emmett regan transmits high frequency rooms speakers incapacitating creature impales aliens exposed head metal rod killing saving emmett time creature foundry discovered bunker attacks evelyn kill regans transmission plays marcuss portable radio incapacitating creature marcus shoots dead evelyns revolver regan leaves hearing aid connected radio stations microphone allowing anyone receiving frequency fight creatures also starring scoot mcnairy marina man dean woodward beau abbott okieriete onaodowan police officer zachary golinger emmetts son lauren ashley cristiano emmetts wife clever premise using sense sound tense little annoyed whispering certain scenes atmosphere remains eerie immersive post-apocalyptic world expanded survival element continues good monsters still stuff nightmares score marco beltrami terrific overall satisfactory horror good!
tt8332922,slasher flick expect silly never split up quickly split up; dont go there immediately going yet film supposedly carries bit thought seems lazy
tt8332922,remember first one entirely able suspend disbelief - respect still rings true high pitch/tone concept still effect - go back day - see (beloved) character survive first movie (yes make sense watch first one seeing then) get glimpse new important character sequel
tt8332922,abbott family continue trying live day day however monsters poses threat
tt8332922,wait sit exact story back release a quiet place first part?
tt8332922,movie starts arrival monsters proceeds immediately first movie death lee abbott (john krasinski) evelyn abbott (emily blunt) three children seek new refuge stumble upon old friend emmett (cillian murphy) believe enough supplies everyone wants
tt8332922,know excitement back theater months movie good enraptured enjoyed sequel even first may sheer giddiness back theater
tt8332922,started good boring middle ending showing signs good strong story ends abruptly like tune next week nevermind wait part unacceptable film end abruptly explanation happens next
tt8332922,best cinema experience ive near full house near silent crowd (some loud eaters heh) may enjoyed lack plot (as much happens) ending see film continuation story (as obvious third) remember right ending first one setting time exact think people get millicent simmonds shines film cillian murphy alongside makes better emily blunt still great steps time lets millicent take spotlight uses perfectly find sequel scary first film scenes jump scares executed well replacing lack scares film big action pieces great big screen would preferred silent scenes sound used jump scare element rather big explosions loud sounds action still intense sound design perfect especially were regans perspective sound cut completely favourite scene definitely opening big action scenes good origin world thing bugged theme family died become every man himself almost get moments revolve around theme family see regan marcus trying like father film trying lead family safety highly recommend seeing film even horror taste appreciate sound production desig
tt8332922,lot potential parts lazily written son becomes idiot daughter becomes idiot abruptly leaves family safety thinks find source radio music herself? one poorly written parts daughters disgust emmet (cillian murphy) seemed way place poorly written people dock explanation behavior - boats never figured creatures cant swim? loved beginning flash back moment initial confrontation aliens need part works id rather prequel showing humans fought aliens initially going hiding
tt8332922,"utshell:
wow first movie ive seen actual theater year! quiet place ii one first movies delay theater release pandemic first started morning invited press screening local theater film critics movie picks right quiet place left following horrific events home abbott family faces terrors outside world forced venture unknown realize creatures hunt sound threats lurking beyond sand path"
tt8332922,funny see pretty good film part wants see happens next well inevitably happens next actually much certainly case film okay film interesting aspects thing first film pretty tense one sort drops ball somewhat mind seeing cinema packed suggest maybe things getting back normal meaning cinema worthy films starting appear big screen people happier go back check
tt8332922,long wait sequel great film quiet place made way cinema uk watched last night review premise film picks straight end last film sees abbot family attempt survive world
tt8332922,- one might expect consider fans first one find plenty love (and even maybe focused plot) like get hype continue see series okay
tt8332922,clearly enjoyed second part dna first one still tense moments enjoyed also flashback beginning introduce emmet character like first one movie contemplative side look nice see always survival enjoyed rythm along :sometimes slow become faster really recommend second part people liked first movie end pretty fast im wondering quiet place part plan one clearly good looking horror movie different style make scare ( trough sound) go
tt8332922,quiet place part far better directed written; could probably say first gap nearly wide aliens drive boats now? music quiet? message coded song? happened crazy people docks? terrible im shocked people think better near-masterpiece first film nothing else lesser mostly
tt8332922,watched first movie almost years ago nice opening sequel scenes recapping happened see families boys baseball game something happens sky soon sightless alien creatures wreaking havoc people running cover know first movie lee survive join mom evelyn kids plus brand new baby witness learning survive
tt8332922,moving pictures full wonderful logical sense bothered even depicted coherent sentences faithfully illustrate movies styles story answer many intriguing questions unquestionably firm logical answers
tt8332922,quiet place part ii movie starts signature move put audience right middle suspense thrill director john krasinskis style storytelling make stuck seat make crave acting performances movie go even bit everyone delivered stunning performance shined whenever got time screen screenplay movie good somewhere middle gets little things become kinda predictable certain point pacing movie starts ends good note bumps middle editing sound design always big highlight movie series shined one also overall movie must watch especially theatres everyone enjoy balance mix suspense thrill good enough story
tt8332922,share tense moments aliens pretty cool many contrivances used set drama kept fully enjoying clearly effective device aliens vulnerable strangely immediately embraced/replicated/used tendency characters run instead standing still alien around extraordinarily placid baby cry recurring theme family members wandering without talking others etc calculated stand lot scrutiny liked strength deaf girl (millicent simmonds) wish film revolved around instead trying hard set scenes mother (emily blunt) brother (noah jupe) awful film credit gets minutes pretty average fare
tt8332922,many things lack sense im commenting cute silly monsters cant stand screechy noise see well cut metal easier butter run kill like terminator liked beyond sea song though good song well sort slasher/monster/horror movie
tt8332922,really loved first a quiet place acknowledging everybody felt unrealistic frustrating character behaviours senseless ending many others found incredibly atmospheric clever genuinely unnerving extremely well acted count someone latter category count also though somebody enthused thought sequel first a quiet place strike one desperately needed
tt8332922,ever watching movie wished every body moved quarter speed?
tt8332922,though horror movies ones tend avoid made quiet place movies much belonging thriller genre horror rely jump-scares suspense will scary scene coming up creepy aliens hear noises kill whoever responsible bit gross look type movie make hide behind pillow
tt8332922,following first film abbott family move trying avoid sound-seeking killer creatures seek refuge old acquaintance accommodating see eye-to-eye things regan sets find radio station may salvation putting great risk
tt8332922,great pleasure watch regan marcus grow replace dads place adults settle assess situation realistically safely young ones hope daringly challenge problems level concentration viewers diminished little compared first one main story divided two a quiet place part ii becomes dynamic adventurous building suspense sound totally works!
tt7395114,wow thought something else think movie would high level artistic grounds great story director shot correct pace would bore us casting excellent great music impressive thing movie im happy netflix delivering content driven good movies nowadays overall recommend movie crazy worth time
tt7395114,film connections among multiple characters fully revealed late movie also number people key principal players suddenly drop picture though obvious reasons turns may concentrate bit whats going average story linear chronology handful flashbacks utilized provide background detail becomes important later viewers slow burn nature picture may prove daunting dark themes may resonate timid stick treated compelling drama young man whos forced straddle line good evil often unsuccessful attempt protect ones loves despicable characters abound picture none wicked preacher preston teagardin (robert pattinson) although forerunner roy laferty (harry melling) would consider close second time film come agree ill fated sheriff lee bodecker (sebastian stan) states young arvin russell critical flashback scene - some people born could buried turns theres lot going
tt7395114,powerful movie! great storyline great acting!
tt7395114,devil time slow burn thriller melodrama outstanding acting exceptional editing precise cinematography love focus theme evil disguised good film focuses people thinking good guise religion god divine right instead harsh reality terrible people committing terrible atrocities unfortunately true life obviously saying religious people evil people using religion excuse commit crimes performances really good provide look minds sick vile humans film deeply disturbing true life focuses real life themes extremely well crafted love presented using voice narration dictate flow film plot little convoluted story couldve thought get ready slow descent disturbing madness one ages
