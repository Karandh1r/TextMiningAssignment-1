tt5918982,"Tasya Vos (Andrea Riseborough) is the Possessor. She's a corporate assassin who uses a brain implant to take over other people to do the killing. Her boss is Girder (Jennifer Jason Leigh). Her next take-over target is Colin Tate (Christopher Abbott) who is dating Ava Parse (Tuppence Middleton), the daughter of tech tycoon John Parse (Sean Bean)."
tt5918982,"Some artful notions swirling around in this one, ""Possessor,"" but not necessarily always amounting to much. A conclusion of a loss of empathy seems especially trite to me. There's so much more potential here than some character arch. More than the satire on the real world, too."
tt5918982,"This should be retitled,""Too Much but also not enough"". There are so many ideas pulling the movie in so many different directions. It's ideas the movie, but rarely does an idea get fully realized here. This has me torn on how I feel. On one hand, there is a unique tone to this. It's like Assassin's Creed meets inception. People possessing other people's bodies to preform hits on specific people for political or social gain is a solid premise on it's own. Throw in some great ultra violent gore effects, good performances, and some moody, atmospheric music and you get some really striking scenes. On the other hand, the movie is overly ambitious. There's so much it establishes there's no way it can accomplish it all, and it doesn't. This is exemplified in the first act which feels horribly rushed. We get less then 20 minutes establishing characters, premise, and themes. It feels like it can't wait to move through the set up and what results is a lack of investment from me. We hardly know who anyone is or why they are doing anything. The main character is having a psychological melt down as a result from over working inside this possessor machine but she only takes like a half day off to recover. Then she's right back to work. There's barely motivation for this and in her half day off all she does is sit around at home with her ex. You needed more scenes explaining to us what lead to her breaking up with him and more establishment of why she would want to go back to him. We don't know these people or their story and we leave them so quickly it's hard to care about them at all. We literally get one scene of her away from her work, and it's nothing out of the ordinary as far as normal day goes. Why is she a workaholic? Her home life seems fine to me. Why won't she tell her superiors that she's having a mental breakdown? Is it supposed to be a metaphor about her dependency on work to avoid her real life? If that's the case then why don't we get more scenes showing why she would be avoiding her life? It's a messy movie, full of vague characters and even murkier story progression. Even though the first act is rushed, at least it sets some interesting things up. The second act is where the movie really faulters though. It feels like the same scenes happening over and over again. It gets really tedious watching a character saying the possessed person is acting weird over and over. There are some cool, trippy, drug like sequences showing the main character having more internal breakdowns but I got the point after the first time. Yeah she's not stable enough to be in there and the longer she is, the worse it will get. I get it. We don't need to see it 27 times. This is weird because the first act has the exact opposite problem. Like Inception these people are trying to accomplish something by manipulating others for their gain. Unlike Inception, where the first half of the movie is establishing characters, story motivations, and potential speed bumps, Possessor only seems interested in establishing the story speed bumps. We don't get a clear sense of character motivation or why the story is happening in the first place. This possessor company wants to own this large tech company? But why? Who knows! The real story is about the Possessor and the Possessy who go to war over who should have control over the body. So why even mention that they want to absorb this tech company? Instead, say that she needs to kill these people just because they are evil or corrupt. That wouldn't change what the movie is going for and it would clean up the story a bit. The whole point is the struggle between the possessed dude and the possessor and coming to terms with the horrible things that happened. It's kinda like watching someone with split personality disorder. Which, again, is an idea that could've and should've been fleshed out. It only comes up near the end and is wrapped up so quickly I don't know why they even bothered. The first act is completely rushed, the second act is drawn out to no end, and the third act introduces more things it can't quite pull off. So...eh?"
tt5918982,"The same thing always happens. A movie gets hyped, I buy in and get excited, then watch it and am mildly interested in it and wonder what all the fervor was all about. It happened all over again with Possessor (or Possessor Uncut), which is not the alternate title to Horror Express (Â©Bill Van Ryn for that joke) and it's not one of the movies within a movie within Popcorn."
tt5918982,"There aren't enough people doing this kind of stuff anymore, you know, the kind of movies David Cronenberg used to do, low budget but well crafted, high concept and not afraid to disturb, then lo and behold, looks like his son took the torch and I couldn't be happier. Possessor has some great performances and nice visual choices, the body horror bits do not disappoint as well and I thought the narrative was engaging from start to finish, found no issues with the pacing whatsoever."
tt5918982,"One of the greatest directors from the 70s forward who put forth the idea of science fiction with body modification and manipulation was David Cronenberg. Imagine being the son of Cronenberg and having to live up to his record of films. It appears that his son Brandon is doing just that and succeeding. His latest film does just that and more, creating a science fiction premise that is frightening and fascinating at the same time."
tt5918982,"In this film, set in the near future, brain implant technology allows one person to inhabit the mind, body, and spirit of another. A clandestine corporation uses this technology to assassinate wealthy and powerful people for profit. The film explores what happens when the host starts to fight to regain control from a guest who is not entirely mentally stable, to begin with."
tt5918982,"The incipit is really good: an agency that perform contract killings, use a very innovative technology that implants a device on the brain of a designated target that allows to the killer to remotely wire. Therefore the person is replaced, his free will is canceled and the killer is then able to complete the assignment, without being directly involved. The concept is really good, but the movie has a lot of issues."
tt5918982,I think this is one of those films you will love or hate.
tt5918982,Got around to watching this last night & thought it would be an alright watch.
tt5918982,.5 out of 5 stars.
tt5918982,Opens really well and sets the scene well. Then rapidly descends into a poor gorefest that has no actual story. The performances are good but there is no empathy felt for the main character. Visually it's ok but nothing special. Too many buts for me. Meh
tt5918982,"Like father, like son."
tt5918982,"Every scene is just vacant looks, sadness, and anger... No likeable characters... No reason to care about anyone... No art... No film..."
tt5918982,"... not only in the main characters but channelling throughout this unoriginal take on nothing you haven't seen before but perhaps with a bit more gore, torment and brutality, although you're never really sure why and you'll find a point close to the middle when you won't really care - valueless with some reasonable effects."
tt5918982,"I enjoyed the shock value moments, but that can't be all there is. It's an interesting premise but it goes almost nowhere. They only take it in one direction but that's more than an hour into the movie. It's well made from a technical perspective, but it had trouble keeping me invested and i felt bored and unsatisfied (1 viewing, 4/8/2021)"
tt5918982,An interesting if not totally pointless premise leads to an interesting if not totally pointless story. At first it's interesting but then stops on one character for the entirety of the movie. This isn't good because it wastes the very notion set up by the premise. We could have had multiple characters undergoing this process yet instead we are left with what turns into a fairly pedestrian affair.
tt5918982,"... that's pretty much it. It just looks good. Well, the acting is alright too, i guess. The pacing is way too slow, literally 2/3 could've been cut into a 12 minutes run time. Though the concept is nice, they didn't able to make an interesting plot (if even there's any plot at all). The ""weird imagery"" and ""violent"" that sole purpose to make it edgy-artsy, didn't work. It ended up boring and dull."
tt5918982,"Similar in ways to existenz and videodrome themes. Really been missing David Cronenberg as he hasnt made many movies recently, so glad to see his sons taken over. His films are getting much better, this one being my favourite by miles so far. Excellent use of London set, nice camera work and its a real gorefest. It doesnt hold back in that respect, and some of the visual dream sequences were 1st class. Its not a perfect film by any means but has a number of strengths that horror film fans will appreciate."
tt5918982,"I had heard great things about Possessor Uncut and eagerly looked forward to watching it. This British/Canadian science fiction/horror is the most brutal movie that I have seen for a while and knocks spots off the vast majority of today's offerings. Directed by Brandon Cronenberg, he certainly is a chip off the old block (David). I have to admit that the plot is not always to follow, I am sure that repeat viewings would help make things clearer (alternatively read a full synopsis). The violence and gore is extreme, plus there are a few scenes of very strong sex and nudity. The sets and locations look good and the acting is excellent. I found the movie impressive and look forward to watching it again, however this is most certainly not a film for everyone."
tt5918982,"It is almost as if, with the advent of streaming media, the critics are desperate for an actual feature to gush over. They picked the wrong movie. There are clever bits here and there, but the directors endless love affair with the tropes of low-budget film making, static scenes, dim lighting -- all these will ultimately disappoint. And the gushers would do well to remember that the director's father may have started with low-budget productions but eventually graduated to blockbusters like A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE. We can only hope."
tt5918982,"The son of David Cronenberg wants to to a movie like Existenz, but he ultimately fails to do so. The acting is good, but the plot is really drawn out and says almost nothing in the end. Also, as many others noted, there is some gratuitous gore and violence put in which doesn't really advance the story in any way, and that extends to some other things as well."
tt5918982,"Visually good, in some places great."
tt5918982,"This one is slow with very few violent scenes, nudity n sex.
A contract killer is able to implant her consciousness into the body of another person in order to carry out an assassination. The assassin is able to control the body of another person but is not able to control the minds of others. A big lol.
It has a wierd sex scene n bloody stabbings but gets tedious."
tt5918982,I really anticipated this movie but I was let down after watching it. 5 stars for the acting. That's it.
tt5918982,"With its good performances, excellent visual design, and all the blood and gore you could ask for, Brandon Cronenberg's 'Possessor' is a thrilling, engaging experience that succeeds in getting under your skin."
tt5918982,"I hate watching films with expectations because they will undoubtedly influence perception/opinion. I admit I did go into this film with some hope that perhaps the young Cronenberg could live up to the family name in terms of cinematic experience to some degree. I at least hoped that it would be a reasonably good film, my expectations were definitely not all that high. I saw some good reviews, but didn't read them and just went to check it out with an open mind and a little hope. My hopes were unfounded as the film really is nothing to be excited about. In fact, I found the film to be profoundly boring. The story isn't bad really, it's somewhat interesting, but it's delivered in slow motion and with a lot of misplaced weirdness. This coming from a lover of weird films. Luis BuÃ±uel, David Lynch and Federico Fellini are among my favorite all time filmmakers for instance. I've never been a fan of weirdness just for the sake of being weird however. Weirdness needs to be interesting, compelling to at least some degree, not completely pointless. This film seems to focus too much on its weirdness and less on the interesting aspects of the story, and to me, none of the weirdness was of any interest. Brandon may indeed one day be a director worth watching, however today is not the day. To me this film was not even in the same league as Father David's first feature Shivers. That film isn't great either, but even it kicks the crap out of this pile of boring."
tt5918982,"Immensely disturbing, shocking and provocative; ""Possessor"" takes you on a wild ride while playing with your mind."
tt5918982,"I enjoyed watching this film, it seemed to be low budget but I thought it was extremely well filmed. There were some really creative and interesting scenes I had never seen before, especially the consciousness transfer. I found it hard to connect with the characters because they were all unlikeable. The concept was cool and one that should be in more movies, by I definitely think the story could be told better with more likeable characters and a clear protagonist and antagonist."
tt5918982,"Cronenberg Jr. had the right idea, and his visuals were stunning - albeit the gore borderline overboard-cheesy, but his writing was riddled with plot and technical issues, and the ending was disappointing, forgettable and not worth the runtime's wait. There were also far too many convoluted scenes as well as many long, unnecessary and dragged out ones. The acting, cinematography and score were decent. The pacing was horribly slow, that the 103 min runtime felt like 3+ hours. This film needed faster pacing, and to be cut down to about 80 mins, with more clarity in the writing - especially the ending. Maybe dad should've given the screenplay a once-over to avoid such amateur errors. It's a generous 6/10 from me."
tt5918982,"I don't think this movie fully works, but I don't want to dismiss it completely. It's aggressively unpleasant for long stretches with a wildly unappealing main character and some unclarity about who's who for a while, but the main character has an emotional (or one might say emotionless) journey that's well built around unpleasantness and the unclarity actually feeds that some of that at the same time. I'm mixed on this, having never really engaged with it on any level while watching it, but having learned to appreciate it on a certain intellectual level as I considered it after it was over."
tt5918982,"It is weird, gory and yet very boring. I just don't understand what is going on."
tt5918982,"This movie is unsettling. To its credit, that is partially due to its commitment to the relentlessly bleak and bloody life of Tasya, a woman whose job is to use a strange machine that lets her inhabit other people's bodies to carry out violent assassinations. The film truly conveys the dread of an alternate universe where such a thing exists. The audience is in a strange position at the edge of the seat waiting to see how this woman and her overlords' missions go, yet also wondering if we should be hoping for their own demise given the immorality of their scheme. It doesn't help that Tasya herself seems perturbed about her own actions."
tt5918982,"The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. You can see where Brandon Cronenberg got his inspiration from. Like his dad he has his own view of making movies. The story is interesting but I can't help it to think the movie could have been better. So for the writing Brandon Cronenberg did a good job, for the directing it could have been better. The acting was good and that from the entire cast. There are some brutal scenes but they fit good in the movie. Overal the movie is worth a watch, curious about his next movie though."
tt5918982,"Featuring an insane premise that only a Cronenberg mind can conceive, Possessor is a visceral blend of cerebral sci-fi & stomach-churning body horror that's surreal, haunting & above all original. Bathing in blood, basking in violence n gore, and blatant in its depiction of corporate greed, the film is equal parts fascinating & equal parts frustrating."
tt5918982,"A girl sticks a wire into her brain and connects it to some device which causes her to display a variety of emotions. She then follows a friend to a party where she sticks a knife into some guys neck then stabs him enthusiastically and repeatedly into the chest. Then she grabs a gun, puts it into her mouth, can't pull the trigger, instead commits suicide by cop."
tt5918982,"I just found the whole movie wrong from the opening scene. The look was off, the pacing was slow, the sound track was tedious and slow panning shots... I simply detest slow panning shots with ambient music. It was an extremely drawn out affair, interjected with frantic disjointed scenes of of graphic violence and sex. I feel this movie was made more for the filmaker's entertainment than the audience. It could have ended (and really should have) twenty minutes sooner. Even though it was about 90 minutes, it felt so much longer to me. The ending was a mess but at that stage I was just happy it was over."
tt5918982,Amazed to see the positive reviews of this movie .It is completely boring and the vocals from the characters can not be understood clearly .It falls flat on its arse .
tt5918982,No amount of eye candy cinematography or grandiose effects can make up for an undeveloped plot that culminates in a cheap copy-paste thriller.
tt5918982,Possessor reminds me of an ultra-violent combination of Inception and Looper.
tt5918982,"Ok, i don't usually write reviews here, although I am an avid movie fanatic."
tt5918982,"My God, this movie is tediuosly slow. And not in a good way."
tt5918982,The movie is very boring and slow for the first 60minutes... then it becomes a rampant gore-fest for about 10minutes and then it returns to being exceptionally boring plus it gets confusing and just down-right strange until the end.
tt5918982,"The Possessor (2020) we recently rented off Amazon Prime for $1.99. The storyline is primarily about a high profile agent who uses brain implant technology to get access to other people's bodies to conduct assassinations for high profile/paying clients. The more missions they conduct the more they deteriorate themselves putting the agency and tasks at risk as their own mental state crumbles due to the technology. This movie is directed by Brandon Cronenberg (Antiviral and son of David Cronenberg) in his second major motion picture. This picture stars Gabrielle Graham (Shadow of the Moon), Hanneke Talbot (Ready or Not), Jennifer Jason Leigh (Dolores Claiborne), Daniel Park (12 Monkeys) and Andrea Riseborough (Oblivion). First off, I love this movie. The kill scenes are often subtle in their execution but also very intense. The delivery of the debilitating factors of the technology is also well delivered in both the storytelling, special effects and acting. Everything about this movie is well thought out and executed. This is a very smart and entertaining film that is definitely worth your time. I'd score this a 8-8.5/10."
tt5918982,"Wow. Brandon Cronenberg has done it. After his debut film, Antiviral - an admirable, but not quite accomplished attempt at picking up where his father David left off - he has created a fully realized and fully original vision in POSSESSOR. Not only do the concepts and aesthetics meet Cronenberg standards, but the levels of brutalism and discomfort are SHOCKING - this might be more brutal than ANY movie that David Cronenberg ever made, yet it feels like it's made in a completely inspired manner and with genuine purpose."
tt5918982,'Possessor' is quite unique.
tt5918982,Let me start by saying how much I HATED this film! This is a bloody film - and also bloody confusing. 'Possessor' is a disgusting film I never want to see again. It is unnecessarily gory and bloody.
tt5918982,"This film start with a woman ""Holly"" sticking a radio stimulate device into her head, and she stabbing a man to death scene! As turnout, this film is about a female agent ""Tasya"" struggle to finish her job by killing her possessed body ""Colin"", and Girder eventually helping Tasya to finish the job! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the drinking scene, overuse of the eating scene, overuse of the hallucinate scene, overuse of the suffering trauma scene, overuse of the flashbacks scene, and overuse of the struggle to suicide scene! Make the film unwatchable! Barely intense scene is, Colin cut off Michael's finger! At the end, Girder possess Ira to kill Colin for Tasya! That's it! Another disappointed film!"
tt5918982,"Disregard low rating under 6.
i feel its a good 7.
yes its a bit slow but not too slow. I personally felt a bit let down in the last scene or two, but personal opinions.....
This movie is surprisingly well thought and have some gores and weird moments. it is not boring.
i would b very please if i be daddy Cronenberg wt this one.
I was expecting a snore fest and this is not.
Its also not a high octane popcorn Hollywood commercial thing.
Watch it!
I like to recommend you check out 2020 The midnight gospel animation series ,also movie Ravenous 1999 and Jacob's ladder 1991"
tt5918982,"Its assassins are plagued with mysterious yet boring ailments that keep the plot from developing meaningfully. In media res doesn't mean ""put us to sleep."""
tt7923220,"This movie has gotten consistently mediocre to poor ratings from various professional viewers. The premise is very interesting but highly unlikely, and many of the choices of the various characters seem unusual and unlikely. Still, my wife and I were entertained, as a Tuesday evening viewing at home on the Kanopy site it entertained us more than many recent movies."
tt7923220,"I have to admit that the premise for ""Inheritance"" is quite unlike any movie I have seen (or heard about) to date, and that I was kept interested in it to see how things would be wrapped up in the end. However, when the end credits started rolling, I didn't find myself satisfied. As others here have stated before me, this movie has quite a lot of holes in its plot. How did nobody know about the bomb shelter before? Why didn't the heroine's father leave her proper instructions about her ""inheritance""? Then there are questions that come up at the end that the movie does not answer, such as the unmentioned fate of the heroine's brother, who simply disappears from the story. The performers do a pretty good job despite the weaknesses in the material, and the entire production looks okay despite a limited budget. I've seen worse on Netflix, I admit, but I think this is one acquisition you should only look at when you've run out of really good movies to watch there."
tt7923220,I like Simon Pegg and Lily Collins but this was a ridiculous premise.
tt7923220,Lost count of how many actions the main characters could have taken to avoid the mayhem.
tt7923220,This was probably one of the most crazy plots that I have seen in a while .
tt7923220,"""Inheritance"" is a direct to video mystery with a mostly unknown cast except for an almost unrecognizable Simon Pegg. 31yo Lily Collins looks much younger, like she's from one of those kids shows on Disney or Nickelodeon. She's really out of place as big city DA ""Lauren Monroe"", so that's a casting fail, which is a problem since she's the lead. That and other plausibility problems take you out of important moments and make this a so-so storytelling when it could've and should've been worth an 8 or 9 rating. The whole production is analogous to doodoo covered with white icing - it looks good enough to eat but heaven help you if you do! For instance, the whole initial premise that her father barely if at all really briefed her on the terrible responsibility of her inheritance just because someone might be listening in is ludicrous. Fine, you can forgive that one maybe since it launches the story but it's followed by too many subsequent implausibilities you'd have to look past to really enjoy the story itself. It's a shame, because the story concept is decent but poorly executed."
tt7923220,"The youngest ever District Attorney in the US is around 35, Marilyn Mosby, Baltimore, the actress cast as a DA here is 30, but she looks about 19, maybe even younger. If you're under 30 or teenager this maybe fine, but as someone old enough to be her Father, I'm afraid this stretches my ability to suspend my disbelief & with very poor reviews, I'm out within minutes."
tt7923220,"Everything just feels so constructed. It is like the three year old who wrote this script constantly said ""I don't care about reality, I want to have it like that"". Maybe he even held his breath until everybody else said ""okay, okay, it makes no sense but we do it like you want us to"". People behave like no real human would ever behave. The dialogues are awful and illogical. The motivations of the characters in this movie are so unbelievable, it really pains to watch them doing one stupid and illogical thing after the other. And the end made it not even better, it made it worse. Because it made the actions during this movie even more stupid and unnecessary."
tt7923220,Inheritance (2020) is a very basic thriller plot painfully stretched over almost 2 hours handled by the most dimwitted slasher-movie-meat characters you will ever see. Maybe it was even a slasher film repurposed as a thriller at some point.
tt7923220,"Nice performances by the lovely Lily Collins and the versatile Simon Pegg were overshadowed by the initial absurdity of the plot at the beginning...a man kept prisoner in an underground bunker for 30 years...aside from Pegg's good health from this unbelievable ordeal, the fact that Collins, a district attorney, played along with her discovery, rather than calling the cops, beggers belief."
tt7923220,"We love Simon Pegg, but this was a bad role choice, and, sorry Lily, but you were not cast well either. Lily is supposedly the DA for Manhattan, yet there is no evidence of her ability for deductive reasoning or keeping her cool in the face of a challenge. No ability to be objective and question things accordingly. She is weak, overly emotional and can't make an intelligent decision to save her life. So...DA for Manhattan? Yeah, right. Oh, and why keep that guy alive? And why hand over such a deep dark secret with no information? Why make it a mystery if she's supposed to carry on the secrecy? If the truth is to ""stay buried"" then why keep the evidence alive and then not give her the information she would need to manage through it? And why when you are left with such a dark secret would you not WAIT FOR THE DAMNED EVIDENCE YOU ASKED YOUR COP FRIEND FOR BEFORE LETTING THE GUY GO?! Whatever. It's a terrible script that makes no sense. Don't bother. Sorry Simon. Sorry Lily."
tt7923220,It is predictable. But. I understand Lauren's motivations for her actions. She spends her life and energy to prove her dad wrong. All just to get some inkling of approval. So I'm not sure why people say there are all these plot holes. Simons character was being punished a fate worse than death. When Lauren finds out about the evil her dad has committed. She does what she feels is needed to right a wrong. In this day and age. It seems like people are always looking to tear movies apart. At least this one had an ending. Lauren was trying to stay true to her on self-imposes convictions. Wanting to believe she had achieved what she had on her own. It's a story someone wrote. Not me or people watching the movie. Honestly. Plot holes no. A hard to believe story. Yes. But. That is why I watch movies. To be entertained and to escape life for a couple of hours. Maybe people are just too jaded in this day and age. Who knows. I think it's worth a look. You could do way worse.
tt7923220,"Lauren Elizabeth Monroe (Lily Collins ) is a hard-nosed City DA going after Wall Street cheats, many of which are associates of her father (Patrick Warburton). Her brother William (Chace Crawford) is running for congress and has union payoff issues for endorsement allegations. When her father passes away, Lauren inherits Simon Pegg chained up in a hidden bomb shelter. At this point, leave you mind at the door and enjoy the interaction and secrets he reveals as Lauren debates his release. The production ends up with a couple of twists that one would expect from a hack writer that ruined everything. It wasn't clever and has been done in too many films. SPOILER: Luke I am your. . ."
tt7923220,"I did enjoy this film to a degree, I like a mystery-thriller and the mystery in this one unravels well, it delivers a satisfyingly slow-burning and eerie tension throughout, but there's a couple of issues and they're pretty big ones:"
tt7923220,"I actually enjoyed this movie for the most part even though the idea that someone had spent 30 years in the hole is pretty far fetched but it was the two main actors, Lilly and Simon that carried this film to a watchable event. Sure, it's not one of the best thrillers I have seen but it's better than most of the new thriller movies I have seen lately on Demand. Only five stars for the film but 8 stars for the two actors.:-)"
tt7923220,"Inheritance while initially intriguing, turns out to be uninspired, unevoking and underwritten."
tt7923220,"Not a flawless film, but for a B-grade film that Matthew Kennedy wrote the story and screenplay - his first ever, it was quite impressive for an amateur writer. There were some minor plot and technical issues, but the 111 min runtime with its on point pacing, held my interest and kept me in suspense. The directing and score were decent, and cinematography was great. All cast performed excellent, especially Pegg, but I felt Lily Collins wasn't the right casting choice; her performance was excellent, and although she's 31 years old, right from the start of the film, her young teenage look wasn't convincing for a fierce D.A. Nevertheless, an enjoyable drama/thriller I'd recommend, especially considering the slim-pickings of films available during the Corona virus. It's a well deserved 8/10 from me."
tt7923220,"This movie is just shy of being a spoof. The ""evil"" character at the center of it is positioned as if he's like Robert De Niro's character in Cape Fear or something... but really, after the story unfolds in its entirety, it turns out he's just some rotten guy who did a terrible thing 30 years ago. *Whomp whomp.* Okay, yes, there's a ""twist"" in the final scene, too, but you can see it a mile away and it, too, lacks any kind of ""OH MY GOSH"" factor."
tt7923220,The premise is illogical.. Why would Lauren's father bequeath her the man in the dungeon without informing her that he is pure evil and must never be released?.. I have to dismiss the entire movie when the premise is illogical...
tt7923220,Lauren who is the main character she's also a da she they made her for being a lawyer making decisions stupidly so for example before making a huge decision you would have figured she would have waited until she got all the information but she didn't until it was too late that's what I mean by lazy the writers just took the easy way out instead of really having to figure out away that wouldn't be true to reality
tt7923220,"I'll just jump right into it. There's too many plot holes. The premise is that the father dies and leaves behind in his inheritance this bloke who's been held captive for 30 years by him. The story is basically trying to find out who he is, why he is there etc"
tt7923220,"I had high hopes that once in a blue moon Netflix showed again something watchable but nope, another absolutely unbelievable b movie with a horrible unsympathetic lead actress. I mean why would anyone not go to the cops when finding a man chained up in a bunker? And she still wants him to be chained up after showing proof. And his role is unbelievable too. I mean why not just grab her gun and get away? Really? Script is laughable and only the lead actor plays a decent role."
tt7923220,"The only disappointing thing about Inheritance is the ratings it gets on IMDb. To me it's seriously underrated, but then again I'm used to it. It's not the first time that I completely disagree with the ratings, in fact there are a lot of movies with this score that I find very entertaining whilst other very highly rated movies are rather boring to watch. Inheritance has an interesting story, the suspense is building up during the entire movie, with good acting from Simon Pegg and Lily Collins, as well as the rest of the cast. It's one of those mystery movies you keep guessing what happened, one that you know there is something odd about it but you stay eager to find out. So no I really don't get what people don't like about this movie. Sometimes you can see a movie is going to suck after just watching a couple minutes, the amateurism just oozes from the beginning, but with Inheritance I immediatly had the opposite reaction after a couple minutes, you can clearly see the cinematography was going to be good, and a good story and acting made it just slightly more entertaining than a just normal 'good' movie. You can't really go wrong with this movie if you like mystery thrillers."
tt7923220,"If only this film had at least as good story as Simon Pegg performance was,now really his acting saved this film from being even bigger disaster and to me he stole every scene that he was in,Lilly Collins in other hand was way to unconvincing as our character,i mean she give solid performance but her character lacked depth and personality,story was also all over the place and mixture of funny moments and dramatic situations wasnt very good,ending and plot twists were also very uneffective and it felt like they wanted to shock viewers with every means neceserey,but they failed in end,cause they tried way to hard for this kind of film,Inheritance was a film worthy of watch just because of Pegg performance,rest of film was rather unorginized and off"
tt7923220,"I'm so confused as why the father would leave a vague message to his D.A. Daughter with zero details.
The whole story is just bad. I'm mad at myself for trying to find logic in this mess."
tt7628504,1 for the nudity n 1 for the locations. That's it.
tt7628504,"Horrible dialogue, lousy acting, amateurish direction, meat cleaver editing....this trainwreck has it all back. There is not a single second of this garbage worth watching. I'd like my rental fee and my time back."
tt7628504,"The twist in this movie is so stupid. Actually the whole movie is stupid! Guy loses his job and goes hitchhiking on his own for no actual reason then he comes upon a random cottage in which 2 women live. He asks for his flask to be filled with water then he has dinner then the woman starts acting crazy, she says she isn't crazy but we know she is because she was crazy in Wrong Turn 5 too. Anyway she chains up the guy in her basement and then has sex with him apparently it's for revenge because some random men raped her sister and the twist is that she's a psychiatric patient and the guy who went hitchhiking for no reason is her doctor and she has been imagining it all.. And then she has these thoughts while she's being transferred in an ambulance to the asylum I assume.. But with the help of the thoughts and an injection nearby she manages to subdue the 2 men in the ambulance and escapes and then it finishes.. And that is the whole movie. I don't even know why they made it and released it like it's good lol."
tt7628504,"There are so many disturbing things about this film. Not only did Megan seems to turn into a female version of Chucky with better fashion sense, the acting for almost all cast was way below par. It was painful to watch. In fact, there were only two good thing about this movie is Allison Williams and Bruce. Curious who hired the casting director because that persons decision making skills should be reevaluated. Like who casted Ronny Chieng as David? Mr. Chieng should follow a new career path. I found myself wanting Megan to kill him so I didn't have to watch him attempt to act. I give this movie two thumbs down but Allison Williams two thumbs up."
tt7628504,"I just watched this movie, and I will not spoil this movie for you, but I will be reviewing this on my YouTube Channel (CEDtalks Entertainment) in the coming days."
tt7628504,"Worth watching and I would watch again. The actors did very well, not one I would consider a weak link. The movie invokes emotion and captures you immediately for ride. I like the element of surprise and it wasn't predictable. The modern day touch mixed with real time dialect was nice, wasn't a cheesy corny moment. Hoping for a sequel with an updated software and more Megan's released at once to see the different variations."
tt7628504,I expected this movie to bring some joy into my life but instead it brought nothing but tears and disappointment. The anount of dissatisfaction this movie has given me is so unforgiving that I must give this move a distasteful review due to bad plot and a bad storyline. If I wanted to watch transformers I would of watched that instead. But no instead I end up watching a obsessive doll try to become mommy to a little ungrateful b*tch. I give this movie a -10/10 this movie is worse than my childhood. I believe that this movie could of been a lot better if the director wasn't influenced by transformers.
tt10886166,I honestly don't know who thought that this movie would be a good idea. It is a complete train wreck for multiple reasons.
tt10886166,"I do not even know where to start. Look, this is nothing but straight up porn. The plot is ridiculous, the chemistry between the two leads is nonexistent, and the acting is even worse. Trust me when I say, you will watch this in fast forward. It is that horrible!"
tt10886166,"A mobster has a woman he's never met kidnapped and when she awakens from the drug given to knock her out, he informs her that she'll be living as his prisoner for 365 days. If after this period she hasn't fallen in love with him, he says he'll let her go. And, this weird rape fantasy ends up proving that in the end that the woman DOES want to be dominated, abused and forced to be a sex slave because the man is so sexy hot."
tt10886166,"There is no plot to speak of, the dialogue is disjointed, the storyline is disjointed, and the ending is a joke... but don't kid yourself that you're watching for any of these things."
tt10886166,"This was probably the worst movie I've ever seen.
The dialogues between the main characters are unbelievably cringy and the plot literally doesn't make any sense. Don't watch this movie unless you wanna waste 2 hours of your life just to give this movie a (probably) 1 star rating too."
tt10886166,"This hardly qualifies as a film. It's basically porn with some random cringey lines and scenes stringed together. The actors can hardly even be called that and the direction is below amateur. The film essentially romanticizes kidnapping and rape too, and for that it should be ashamed. This is truly the bottom of the barrel for 2020."
tt10886166,Such a rip off from fifty shades of grey. The plot and character development is all over the place. Some things didn't make any sense at all. The ending was horrible. Where's my 2 hours gone?
tt10886166,"Wow just wow,im in shock how bad this film was in every possible way in movie making industry,this is actually big insult to every person that ever did a movie before or is just planning to make one,everything is horrible here,acting was one of worsest that i ever saw,lines and dialogue were horrible from beginning till end,story was awful in a hideous ways,and movies entire premise and message is so disgusting and wrong that i think that director of this film should pay some punishment for making this abomination,seriously screw this film in hell were it belongs with every other crap that was realesed this year,dont watch this film or you will hate yourself if you do"

tt10886166,"Never seen such horrible movie in my entire life. The concept, acting, scenes, basically everything is wrong in this movie."
tt10886166,"This movie is porn for Karens who think they're too good to watch actual porn, so they watch this ridiculous rape-fantasy garbage instead (another example being 50 Shades of Grey). Of course, filmmaking wise, it's an insult to everyone's intelligence and has some of the worst production I've ever seen. I can't believe Netflix is paying money to stream this. I've seen pornos that are legitimately better films."

tt10886166,"Such stupid, worthless, toxic story line . Glorification of relationships where the sole role of a woman is to be a slave and fulfill the desires of a harsh , egotistic ,rich male character."
tt10886166,"This is what happens when you have a script for a porno and think ""you know what? I bet if I make the sex scenes less explicit I can turn this into a theatrical movie"", but you keep the awful dialogue and the disgusting kidnaping plot that was too tasteless for even the most desperate porn studios and expect no one to notice."
tt10886166,"This is such a horrible movie. I do not understand how it's at the top on my list on Netflix? Crazy. I just created an account just to review how horrible this movie is. I agree with all the bad ratings that other users have posted. I'm not sure if this is what they think women want and I guess you would consider this to be like every woman's wet dream? But there's no plot, the dialogue is terrible, and sure women like being dominated from time to time but not to that extreme and the guy isn't even sweet or gentle as he claims. He is only sweet or gentle after he gets his and i feel like that's kind of backwards. I felt like I was just watching porn and that's it. I did enjoy the main actress, I think she is just stunning but I found it funny how they kept putting her in the same low cut black dress with the same hair. *Spoiler* When it came to the ball scene, I expected a even more beautiful transformation with a flashy dress and hair done but nope.. just stuck to the same style she's been wearing. Another *Spoiler* when she falls in love.. what is she falling in love with? He hasn't done anything redeeming nor has a redeeming quality. Don't confuse lust and good sex with love."
tt10886166,The cringe levels runeth over. The English is almost as bad as the plot. If you want to watch this movie do so as a drinking game. Did you cringe? Then take a shot my dude. You will be wasted by the end.

Massimo is a gangster - but the young, sexy kind: he's described as having ""a body sculpted by God... and a dick sculpted by the devil"" (which is a pretty erotic line until the viewer unwillingly starts picturing said protuberance with horns and a little pointy beard). Having caught a fleeting glimpse of Laura some years before and been obsessed with her ever since, Massimo is delighted to discover she is holidaying on his native Sicily. He promptly kidnaps her and tells her he will hold her for 365 days while attempting to make her fall in love with him."
tt10886166,"Don't believe all the 8-10 stars reviews, they are wanker friends of cast and crew.
There is no way any person on earth enjoyed this movie; let alone thought it was a 10 star film.
It is truly unbelievable how this movie managed to get released.
It is with all honesty really really bad.
Terrible Awful Crap

tt10886166,"How can Netflix show this movie? watched only a few sequences, it is very badly acted and it is definitely promoting violence against women. That's a big NO."
tt10886166,"I implore you not to waste your time watching this. And honestly, the only thing worse than this garbage film is the soundtrack. I saw the reviews for this movie and thought ""oh this sounds like it will be a silly bad movie to fill up my afternoon"" NOPE. It was just bad. Awful. Actually painful to watch at times. Just say no. STUPID."
tt10886166,"This movie is legit the third worst movie I've ever seen. Incoherent plot, stupid characters, completely illogical in every sense of the word. My advice would be to avoid this hot mess at all costs."
tt10886166,"When we watch a lot of films, it is natural to watch some very bad films. But what about a film that clearly proposes to be a pastiche of the already superficial and debatable 50SHADES OF GREY? The film 365 DAYS - a huge success at NETFLIX - is really a cinematographic product difficult to see, given the obviousness of its plot, scenes and ending. The great film critic from Rio Grande do Sul, Tuio Becker, once wrote a review about the movie LIPSTICK (with the Heminghway sisters) which was called ""Boring, Bad and Moralist"". I can paraphrase the great Tuio Becker to describe 365 DAYS."

They collected every cliche from the book of cringe and romance and shoved them in a movie. I can't even humor the movie by listing the things that are bad with it, doesn't even deserve the time or effort, the two hours I wasted watching it were more than enough."
tt10886166,"If you want to watch an erotic movie, this movie is a good one, but if you prefer to enjoy the story, this is the worst. You can't believe the characters.
Cinematography has done well. Italy's landscapes and buildings are beautiful."
tt10886166,"A Polish erotic drama.
It's about a gangster who kidnaps the girl from his visions so that she falls in love with him.
Performances that leave a lot to be desired. They only sell you the physique.
Pretentious
Explicit sexual scenes, in fact it is the only resource that the film uses, that and eroticism.
The story's arguments don't make much sense.
Since when did violence, crime, kidnapping, misogyny and gender violence become something romantic?
Pathetic how a kidnapped person reacts.
This closely resembles 50 Shades of Gray as it uses the same misogynous resources.
The ending is the only thing that does the film justice."
tt10886166,Such a waste of time. How did Netflix even pick this movie up
tt10886166,"This makes pornography look intellectual. Horribly written, bad acting, nothing redeeming about any character nor interesting.

This movie should be destroyed!"
tt10886166,"I became an official voter for the Razzies in 2020, not long before the world was devastated by the coronavirus pandemic, and with cinemas being closed, it meant that the nominations for the Golden Raspberry Awards would include digital platform releases. This Polish film was one listed in the suggested films to be nominated for the awards, it was surrounded by a high amount of negativity and controversy, including for it to be removed from Netflix, so I watched it as soon as possible. Basically, during a meeting between the Torricelli Sicilian Mafia crime family and black-market dealers, Massimo Torricelli (Razzie nominated Michele Morrone) sees a beautiful woman on a beach. Moments later, Massimo and his father (Gianni Parisi), leader of the Sicilian Mafia family, are both shot by the dealers; Massimo survives while his father dies. Five years later, Massimo is now the leader of the Torricelli crime family. He is often urging to fulfil his sexual pleasure and can only be satisfied by women he hires to perform oral sex and other acts with him. In Warsaw, Laura Biel (Razzie nominated Anna-Maria Sieklucka), a beautiful sales director working in a luxurious hotel, is unhappy in her relationship with her boyfriend Martin (Mateusz Lasowski), and longing for sexual pleasure herself. Laura celebrates her 29th birthday in Italy, but after Martin embarrasses her, she goes for a walk and runs into Massimo, who kidnaps her. Laura finds herself being held captive at Massimo's villa. He reveals that she is the woman he saw on the beach when he was injured. He has been thinking about and searching for her for five years. Massimo tells Laura that he intends to keep her as a prisoner for 365 days until she falls in love with him. He also promises her that he will not touch her without her consent, whilst simultaneously having his hands around her throat and touching her. When Laura tries to escape, he does not let her leave. With no choice but to stay with him, she accepts and takes of advantage of the luxurious lifestyle. As they spend time together, Laura teases him and then refuses to have sex with him. However, she slowly starts to get him to open up about his personal life. At a hotel in Rome, she teases him again. Massimo cuffs her to the bed and forces her to watch him as he receives oral sex from another woman. Afterward, she appears to want to give in. But he releases her and orders her to get dressed for a night out. At the club, Massimo is angered as Laura flaunts herself in front of him and his friends. When she begins to flirt with a man from the rival mafia family, the man gropes her against her will. Massimo and the others draw their weapons while Laura is taken out of the club. The following morning, she wakes on a yacht to see Massimo and his fellow mafioso, Mario (Bronislaw Wroclawski), arguing. During the night, a mafia war between the two families has ignited, after Massimo shot the man who groped Laura in his hand. Laura attempts to apologise, but Massimo blames her for the incident. As they argue, Laura falls from the side into the water. Massimo jumps in and saves her. When she awakens, he admits he was scared she might not make it and does not want to lose her. Laura finally gives into her feelings and sexual desires, gives Massimo oral sex, before the proceed to make love on the bed, and numerous times in numerous positions in other places on the yacht. After a long time being incarcerated, Massimo allows Laura to visit her family in Warsaw. He tells her he loves her and will join her after finishing up business. In Warsaw, Laura waits for Massimo for days with no contact. She reconnects with her friend Olga (Magdalena Lamparska) and they go clubbing. At the club, she runs into Martin, who says he has been looking. He wants to apologise and reconcile. He follows her back to her apartment, where Massimo is unexpectedly waiting. After Martin leaves, they have sex, during which Laura sees wounds on Massimo's body, wounds from the mafia war. She confesses to him that she loves him. The next morning, Laura is surprised when Massimo proposes, to which she accepts. However, she tells him she wants him to keep his ""occupation"" a secret from her parents. Back in Italy, Mario informs Massimo of rising tensions. Laura mentions feeling unwell but decides not to see a doctor. They discuss their upcoming wedding, she does want her family to know what Massimo does, so they are not allowed to attend. However, Massimo allows Laura to invite Olga as her bridesmaid. When Olga visits, Laura tells her she is pregnant. Olga urges her to tell Massimo about the pregnancy. Meanwhile, Mario receives a phone call from an informant that the rival mafia family has threatened to kill Laura. Laura and Olga are driving through the hills, and Laura's car enters a tunnel but does not come out the other side. Mario rushes to find Massimo just as Laura's call to him is cut off. Massimo breaks down, as it is implied Laura is dead, with police gathering at the entrance of the tunnel. Also starring Otar Saralidze as Domenico, Natasza Urbanska as Anna, Grazyna Szapolowska as Klara Biel, Laura's mother, and Tomasz Stockinger as Tomasz Biel, Laura's father. Morrone is good looking and Sieklucka is beautiful, there is only a little chemistry between them, the morality of the situation is concerning. The film has 0% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, it is listed in the IMDb Bottom 100 list, and there is a petition to have it removed from Netflix. This is due to its sexual violence, and that it apparently is ""glorifying Stockholm Syndrome and abuse"". There was the slightest part of me that went along with it, being so ridiculous (I can see the comparison to Fifty Shades of Grey), the softcore porn style sex scenes and violence certainly get your attention, and maybe some songs in the soundtrack, but otherwise it is a dark and daft ""love"" story, a silly and unconvincing erotic romantic drama. It won the Razzie for Worst Screenplay, and it was nominated for Worst Picture, Worst Director for Barbara Bialowas, and Worst Remake, Rip-Off or Sequel (rip-off of Fifty Shades of Grey). Adequate!"
tt10886166,"Who wrote this plot then decided it was okay?!? I mean this man not only kidnaps a girl and forces her to love him, but has horrible one liners. Twilight was toxic but this takes it to another level. I kept excepting him to murder her. But he was attractive so u guess him being crazy and a stalker doesn't matter."
tt10886166,"This is not romance. This is built on stalking, kidnapping, dismissal of informed consent. The female character is given 365 days to develop ""stockholm syndrome."""
tt10886166,"The movie got quite infamous - I think it was in the top 10 in many countries, because of ... word of mouth. Though mouths are being used for things here, that will be quite appalling to some. You don't even have to be a prude to feel this goes a bit too far. This is quite the understatement to be honest, because it is quite explicit."
tt10886166,"My boyfriend and I were rooting the whole time that Laura was going to strangle or shoot the dude or something, because then that would have redeemed the movie a little. Spoiler alert: Doesn't happen. She basically gets Stockholm Syndrome over a man who kidnaps her and assaults her repeatedly. Just, what?"
tt10886166,This film basically acts like the sexist and pitiful dreams of a loser who has never interacted with women or anybody else for that matter without having ulterior motives. I can't even put into words how sad and ridiculous the idea behind this movie is and the execution of it is somehow even worse.
tt10886166,"365 days is about a successful but unhappy young woman whose path crosses with that of a young, handsome mafia boss. He kidnaps her and gives her a deadline of one year to fall in love with him. Despite the rough introduction, she eventually gives in to his charms and falls in love with him. The central core of the movie is domination, or how the male protagonist uses his raw masculinity to completely overwhelm the girl until she eventually gives in to her lust, so, this movie is a very obvious copycat of 50 Shades of Grey."
tt10886166,"The plot was trash. Even fifty shades series had better plots than this. Things happen out of nowhere, I was confused the whole time watching this movie. Couldn't even get myself to finish watching till the end"
tt10886166,"Despite the stupidity and the many holes in this movie, we all know it belongs to somewhere else and it's not Netflix"
tt10886166,"I feel stupid even writing a review about it, so basically. Sex, sex, sex, and more sex."
tt10886166,"Not sure why number one in uk. It is poorly written and would not recommend this film, even to a fifty shades fan. If you want a bit of sexy, plenty better then this. Think this film gives the wrong impression of love..."
tt10886166,This movie made me laugh so hard I almost peed myself. Pretty sure it's not supposed to be a comedy tho...
tt10886166,I found the plot of this movie incredibly offensive. It's basically romanticizing an extremely toxic unhealthy relationship. The script and the acting were also both pretty horrible.
tt10886166,"In my life and this one comes pretty close to taking the cake. No story until the last minute, terrible acting, ""erotic"" scenes that made me laugh, weak dialog and in general hands down an awful show. Netflix must have got a huge discount on the purchase price or the director had a nocturnal emission when plotting the show. Scenery was nice though and a better actor than any of the cast. Chalk up a couple of wasted hours on Sunday afternoon. Lots of oral sex, if you're interested in that sort of thing but it was funny instead of erotic."
tt10886166,"The plot was loosely constructed filler for the scenes in between the porn. It was like 50 shades of grey meets, pornhub meets polish twilight meets general hospital. The dialogue was surface level and cringy. Nothing was remotely convincing and the world building was weak at best. The whole film seems like fan fiction put on screen. The only good thing about this film was the lighting and use of color. Everything else was sub par at best. Not to mention the problematic subject matter and sexist undertones. If you wanna a better film with sexual tension I'd recommend call me by your name or In the mood for love, don't give this film your time."
tt7126948,"The first one was fun and well played out. This sequel is a total misfire. Not because it follows the trend of having women being the alpha characters and portraying men as either weak or stupid, but simply because it's a lazy effort. Except a couple of scenes, and hilarious over-the-top acting by Pedro Pascal, I found nothing here. It has ""straight-to-DVD"" written all over it."
tt7126948,"This sequel turns out to be a surprisingly poor affair, suffering from the usual problems like slow pacing, reliance on cheesy humour, and overlong running times that always seem to mar modern superhero movies. The characters are back for a new setting (not that this feels very '80s aside from the satire on greed copied from WALL STREET) but this is almost action-free and the CGI fights are purely by rote. Even worse, we're saddled with the lamest villain in a superhero movie in the form of Pedro Pascal; he's not imposing at all, just mildly amusing, and the ending as such is a real damp squib. How could they get it so wrong with all this money behind it?"
tt7126948,"The first film is outstanding, it's exciting, it's fun, and apart from looking amazing, it has depth."
tt7126948,"After the success of Wonder Woman (2017), I expect a lot of DC fans (and Gal Gadot fans) were wishing for a bigger and even better sequel for the beautiful Amazonian princess. Well, they've got the bigger sequel they wanted, but better? Nope... trickster god Dolos seems to have pulled another fast one: WW84 is one terrible scene after another, a film destined for a cult following perhaps, purely because it is so awful."
tt7126948,I've been eagerly waiting for this. I made a great lunch of Christmas Eve leftovers and sat down - ready for a great movie.
tt7126948,"First off, I loved the first movie and was looking forward to the sequel. That being said, this was a disappointing convoluted mess. It's like a train wreck and a dumpster fire had a baby, then the baby puked and that puke became this movie. Seriously, what were they thinking with this script? So many talented actors and so much wasted potential."
tt7126948,"Nothing in this really seem like 1984...and what did was contrived. And in 1984 the Cold War was not between the USA and Russia, it was between the USA and the USSR! The USSR didn't dissolve until 1991! Jeez, it's not even ancient history. You could've just asked anyone over 40!"
tt7126948,"This movie has some really bad points. It isn't the worst action hero movie ever. It's 80% bad with some redeeming qualities here and there.
Firstly the bad points:
1. The story. This silly ""wish"" premise is weak and wears thin very fast. Be careful for what you wish for. Even a 1984 movie wouldn't have such a simplistic premise. It gets too overblown at the end. The writers really did a bad job. It's beyond low mentality and cliched. And things really fizzle out at the climax.
2. Long winded scenes. Many scenes could have been cut in half to keep the momentum going. From the overlong competition in the beginning, almost every scene could have been trimmed by a quarter.
The good points:
1. Gal Gadot is watchable and likeable - she could read the phone book and it would be watchable.
2. Pedro Pascal of Narcos is the villain here and he looks quite different - good that he has a big movie role.
3. Kristen Wiig has a remarkable transformation and her character is quite interesting.
4. Watch out for Lynda Carter.
The cast is good but they can't save a bad story. Chris Pine looks a bit haggard.
5. The production values are fine - it is a big budget movie. And the cinematography is good."
tt7126948,"I recently had the pleasure, or what it a displeasure, either way I sat thru watching this trash and wondered when in hell it would all end, 2 hours and 31 minutes later in creeped to an end, but wait, in the end, the Easter Egg, made this horrible, terrible movie a littles less trashy."
tt7126948,"Being a good director does NOT mean being a capable storyteller/screenwriter. No fault of the actors, this story and script was a bunched up carpet, riddled with holes. A rushed telling with a timeline that doesn't fit WW's other DCU appearances (i.e. tells Batman in current day/decades after the events in this film she ""disappeared"" and stayed hidden... not exactly what happens in 1984...) , a lazy plot device that requires absolutely no detective work by our heroine (Barbara does the one research scene and delivers all we need to know in one scene of dialogue condensed in one phone call; Diana finds the main villain almost immediately just driving on a road...), illogical/tired trope decisions transparently made for cheap reactions (Barb being a nerd complete with glasses, not being able to walk in heels and dropping things; Steve's outfit montage...), WW's powers being all over the place (she loses Steve unexpectedly and ""discovers"" her power in the first WW film and defeats Ares, the GOD OF WAR, but after revoking her wish in this film to regain her powers she can't stand her ground against the WIND created by a human who absorbed the powers of a little TRINKET another god created for kicks/laughs...), and no consequences for the main villain at the end - which completely decimates the original ""lesson"" from the beginning, about how cheating to gain what you haven't earned is... bad. The movie lost me when Steve was brought back... in another man's body. WHY. WHY? If the stone is so powerful, why couldn't it just manifest him as himself, instead of some poor dude who probably got fired for not showings up for days and got dumped by his girlfriend...etc. The way Diana and Steve just take over this person's apartment and life with no concern is strange, concerning, and completely out of character. There's so much more... Cheetah looking nothing like the comics, how much damage she was able to do to supposedly indestructible armor, no explanation of if the ENTIRE POPULATION OF THE WORLD would remember the events of this movie and if not, why/how... I'll just stop here. I heard there's a third film in the works - hope they learn from their mistakes."
tt7126948,"Writer, producer and director Patty Jenkins really did a give this movie a feminine/soap opera touch and by doing so destroyed everything that this movie could have been. The first WW movie was not that great, but Patty did not write that one, this sequel she did and it is worthless. I was wondering if I was watching a drama or a action hero franchise. First the movie is far to long, the dialogue's are pointless and boring, you can skip with ease them because the story is not that complicated. For the action, the effects are good, not worth the time to watch, but still well made, but there are not very much action scenes. If you look at the demographic of the votes you can see girls <18 years are the only ones who love this movie, and that should have been the warning that should have been given with this movie: only see this movie if you are a teenage girl."
tt7126948,"WW84 is entertaining, but unfortunately not as good as other DC films (or generally films of the superhero genre)."
tt7126948,"Wonder Woman's powers have been pretty unclear in the DCEU thus far, and this movie didn't help things. In fact, Wonder Woman 1984 kind of makes up abilities for everyone just to further the plot. Plus, the characters don't really talk to each other, they just all seem to be trying to dispense profound fortune cookie messages about truth, hope, and desire. This is a messy, overly long movie with a half-baked plot that's covered in bright & colorful 80s-themed frosting."
tt7126948,"So I finally figured out why this movie is called Wonder Woman 1984. That's because it takes its inspiration from the pre-Marvel Cinematic Universe superhero movies that are adaptions of the comics in name only. I'm looking at you, Supergirl, which came out in 1984*."
tt7126948,Wonder Woman is not wonderful.
tt7126948,1. Background of WW youth story seemed very artificially seen-before-unlikely. Not creative or interesting.
tt7126948,"PROS
"
tt7126948,"The follow-up chapter to Wonder Woman and the ninth instalment in the DC Extended Universe, Wonder Woman 1984 is devoid of everything that was refreshing about the original. Poorly envisioned, shoddily scripted & lazily directed, the film neither has the heart nor the honesty of its predecessor, and is a bland, banal & bloated mess that's further marred by its soulless drama, insipid action, cartoonish effects & lame performances."
tt7126948,This is gonna be a long one... here we go...
tt7126948,"The year is 1984. For some reason. Diana(Gadot, asked to carry a lot of the movie on her shoulders, and, sadly for all of us, out of her depth) still misses Steve Trevor(Pine, charming as ever, given less to do than last time). You'd think she misses her people, family, home country, more than the guy she knew for a week 66 years ago, but whatever. One day, he mysteriously returns. And a number of people are having wishes granted. Can something like that happen without serious consequences? And is it possible to include a moral message about that, without getting extremely condescending?"
tt7126948,"Very colorful, lots of money spent. Kristin Wiig was a masterpiece of miscasting. She wasn't funny; she wasn't scary, but great costume. The whole plot was a vehicle to resurrect Chris Pine, but there was no real chemistry between them. It made the lines of endearment quite awkward and the embraces seemed forced. All the usual tropes: WW loses some of her powers, so there can be suspense; she plays Spiderman and holds two vehicles apart. Just nothing new and Gad Gadot proves again that she's a glamour model and poses well. She can't act. Still - entertainment in a vacuum of good movies, so watch it and be distracted for TWO AND A HALF hours."
tt7126948,I have low expectations for DC movies. Some have delightfully surprised me. This falls flat on its face after 15-20 mins and never gets up...or even TRIES!! It felt rushed through production (definitely not in watch speed...). It was boring when their wasn't action and when the action started it was so fake it was distracting. Gadot and Pascal try and maybe have moments that don't suck. Wiig was...well exactly how you would expect her in an action film as a villain.
tt7126948,"I am no expert in comic books myself, but what I expect from a comic book movie is to be striking, visual, stereotypical and above all, consistent with its past and its planned future. WW84 was neither of these! It wasn't awful for a random movie made by students, but it was really bad for a film made by a major studio and starring talented people and having so much material to draw inspiration from."
tt7126948,"Why is Warner Brothers hell bent on destroying a potential gold mine, that is the DC franchise. I thought they had finally sorted it with WW and Aquaman. But no, normality resumes. This movie was terrible at everything. Story, dialogue, acting, cgi. Just sell the franchise to another studio and give us DC fans a break"
tt7126948,"I find this film long and boring. The build up take far too long, and scenes just drag on and on. It doesn't have the powerful touch of the original."
tt7126948,The sequel to Wonder Woman was rescheduled time and time again because of the emergence of COVID-19 and cinemas being off limits. It's finally been released however but can also be streamed on HBO Max which has made some to say that cinemas may be a thing of the past.
tt7126948,"I did actually enjoy the 2017 movie ""Wonder Woman"" quite a bit, so I was definitely looking forward to this 2020 movie from writers Patty Jenkins, Geoff Johns and Dave Callaham."
tt7126948,"I am embarrassed for the cast and the crew. You keep watching this and trying to find someone, something, a scene, a character that is praiseworthy so you find some balance and nada."
tt7126948,"I agree with the review ""utter disappointment"", I also read the Washington Post article. "" really getting to do whatever I wanted"" she said. And what a sad commentary that turned out to be. All of her characters, props and settings were ridiculous. Kristen Wiig injects one of her babbling SNL characters in her first scene. A super villian she's not, even for comic relief. And where is the strong empowered woman that encourages other women to use their own powers? Then there is that magic lasso, Diana might just as well sat and her desk in the museum and flicked it to and fro since it appeared to have an infinite length this time around. Placing the film in her memories of the '80s this might work for Coppola or Scorsese but one's sense of history needs to be able to look further into the past to develop a view. Was that President supposed to be Reagan, surely you could have found someone who actually resembled him. So much for '80s memories. The scenes of an injured and defeated WW were way to drawn out, and the computers of the day were only beginning to go beyond pixelated pictures. The technology of the day would not have been able to broadcast to the world. And Gal Gadots talents were never realized she just wasn't involved enough beyond window dressing, more attention was spent on the sets and locations. And what disappointment the release streaming and theatre distribution. Although I love theaters (I spent 35 yrsin the movie business) where I live they haven't reopened yet. THe streaming was terrible stop, stutter, freeze. fortunately the movie was so bad the pauses were a relief. I wonder what Bill Diehl or Roger Ebert would have had to say about WW84? I'm glad I watched the credits, I couldn't believe how many people were listed. But then Lynda Carter made an appearance. 15 seconds of Joy out of 2 and 1/2 hours."
tt7126948,"Too long, too slow. Quite uninteresting. An absolute ton of plot holes. DC destroy another movie. Did Gal Gadot forget how to act? Don't waste your time."
tt7126948,"This has to be one of the worst movies of 2020. I waited patiently for this film to release and I was dismayed by what I saw. The action is dull, the acting is wooden and dialogue sounds like it was written by a first time writer. If you love cliches this is your movie. It's filled with them and you just have to roll your eyes. Superman v. Batman is far more superior than this film. Director Patty Jenkins really dropped the ball. The first film was so much better. What blows my mind is that the movie was directed by the same person who directed the first one. I think it was the right decision to split the release between digital and theatrical because it was not going to make its profit back just by doing a theatrical release, let alone on demand. I don't recommend this movie. I'd advise you wait until it's free on tv in about a year. It's that bad. It pains me to be so critical of Wonder Woman because I'm a huge fan. However, I'm not a fan of a director who can't even make a decent sequel. This is the same director who is going to direct Star Wars Rouge Squadron in 2023. If you love Gal Gadot check this movie out, other then that this is a hard pass."
tt7126948,"I don't mind the premise of 1984, it's just executed poorly."
tt7126948,"The first WW movie was amazing! It clearly demonstrated that a woman super hero can be strong, smart, funny and, most of all, can easily hold her own with her male counterparts. It was a monumental step forward for super hero movies and women in general and I couldn't wait for the sequel. It was very disappointing to see the direction Mrs. Jenkins took this character. The WW in this movie represents and displays all of the stereotypical cliches so many serious actresses have worked for years to dispel. In the first WW she was a badass who fought with passion against evil and stood up for her convictions. In WW84, when she's not pining for her lost love (because we all know a woman is lost without her man, right?) she's winking at little kids while she fights campy bad guys who are literally tripping over themselves to get caught. The female supporting cast isn't much better. Kristen Wiig is the embodiment of the frazzled, clingy stereotype that went out of style in most movies years ago. The only 2 strong women (Connie Nielsen amd Robin Wright) are gone after the first 10 minutes and we are left with weak, campy garbage. The WW in the first film was Christian Bale's Batman. In WW84 we get the Adam West Batman. Such a disappointment."
tt7126948,"This movie should've had audiences cheering! There's just no excuse for how much of a mess this entire movie was. It's Wonder Woman, it's colorful, its the 80's, it cost a fortune - so why is this movie no fun? Unfortunately, it's just bad, uninspired storytelling."
tt7126948,"Very long winded and quite soppy, I found myself getting quite bored. I m not really sure what this movie is trying to be, a drama love story maybe with a few action scenes. Disappointed."
tt7126948,"Hire Jenkins. She single-handedly wrote and directed the worst superhero film in the history of super hero films, and there's no close second. That was the longest waste of time watching the sappiest superhero movie."
tt7126948,"The 1st WW film was absolutely brilliant and had more ticks than a farmer's dog in my book. WW84 is, which truly saddens and maddens me, the polar opposite. It has a script so weak it should be classed as highly vulnerable, a plot that has more holes than my kitchen colander, and characters about as believable as a career politician.
I did love the opening island scene where the girl actress playing the young Diana was superb, and apparently did all her non-cgi stunts. But then it went downhill faster than an illiterate skier passing a 'Warning - cliff ahead' sign.
I won't go into detail over WW84s failings as I have a bus to catch...in a week, but I think I can reveal my favourite, jaw-dropping line from the film without it being a spoiler..."
tt7126948,"Gosh the first film was amazing almost 10/10 for me. I feel like this sequal had a piss poor script. This film felt very budget as well. I feel like with superhero films like the avengers we expect a lot of eye catching or exciting moments with glimpses of comedy and built up touching scenes. This lacked all of that and it tries so hard to be emotional but still fails. I had to watch this in three separate days because I kept falling asleep. The villain is dorky and cliche, the relationships and ""touchy"" moments didn't move me at all and I'm an emotional kinda guy. 1.5 hours into the film, only two very brief action scenes take place in which they were very frustrating to watch and the rest is boring dialog and bad character development with cliche characters to top it off. The ending was also extremely anti climatic."
tt7126948,I went in not looking at a single review just excited to finally see a movie in theaters this year. Man it really sucked though.
tt7126948,"It's 1984 in Washington, D.C. Diana Prince (Gal Gadot) fights crime as Wonder Woman. During the day, she works at the Smithsonian Institution where she befriends bumbling newcomer Barbara Minerva (Kristen Wiig). Diana is terribly lonely pining for lost love Steve Trevor (Chris Pine). The FBI needs Minerva to identify a stolen artifact which turns out to be a wishing stone. Diana wishes for Steve while Barbara wishes to be like Diana. Eager TV huckster Maxwell Lord (Pedro Pascal) has been searching for the stone and decides on an unusual wish."
tt7126948,"""Wonder Woman 1984"" is an Action - Fantasy movie and the sequel of ""Wonder Woman"", in which we watch another adventure of Wonder Woman during 1980's. She tries to save humanity while she faces two new villains who have other plans and many ambitions to change the world."
tt7126948,"When the first ""Wonder Woman"" film came out in 2017, it quickly became a cultural touchstone. A female-centric superhero film, directed by a woman, in the heart of the Me Too movement. Not only that, but it was simply a damn good superhero flick as well, pulling me back into the DC cinematic universe after being burned time and time again by Zack Snyder material. As such, I was very excited to see how this sequel would build upon that initial franchise success. In short: it didn't. In fact, in a mind-boggling turn of events, there is almost nothing here I can even remotely respect or enjoy."
tt7126948,"I will settle for Zack Synder. After seeing WW1984 tonight, I will never watch anything with Patty Jenkins' name on it. Pedro Pascal is awful. He was awful in Kingsman 2 and he's a cringeworthy cartoonish mess in WW1984. A good director would have reigned him in. Please keep Prince Oberyn out of movies. If we want to see Kristen Wiig, we'll rewatch Bridesmaids. Hollywood, please stop casting Kristen Wiig. She is badly miscast in WW1984. She looks uncomfortable and lost. Please Stop Resurrecting Steve Trevor. Gal Gadot is a very likeable, gorgeous, strong lead. She deserved a better movie, not this overindulgent, bloated, chaotic mess. Wow, it was unbelievably bad"
tt7126948,"Fifteen minutes into the movie and I've writing this review while I'm watching the movie because I know I won't miss anything. Even the 70's WW series with Linda Carter was less campy than this movie. It's too bad, I really enjoyed the first Wonder Woman. As a matter of fact, I think stop watching this and go rent the 70's WW series. You should too."
tt7126948,"This film is dribble . I absolutely love Kristen Wiig but she / her agent was asleep behind the wheel when they agreed to give her talent to this . I hope they paid her so much to be in this P. O. S. The script is horrendous. I know superhero movies are fantasy but this one was outrageous. They spent a lot on it and the visuals are impressive but still a magic stone common. A skimpy dressed poorly acted female Protagonists surely can't be the be what the world needs . Honestly the longer the film goes the worst it gets. It's set in 1984 for no purpose besides lowest common denominator jokes and outfits. I like superhero movies a lot but this film sucked . The plot was long winded , sappy and the acting fell short even though good actors. Weird to think films like this exist. I'll watch many superhero films again especially Tim Burton's Batman but I will never watch this again. I recon you skip it."
tt7126948,"Lets not kid ourselves, 2017's Wonder Woman was no cinematic classic but when compared to this second outing, the 2017 Gal Gadot starring and Patty Jenkin's directed hit looks like the Citizen Kane of superhero films."
tt7126948,"The predecessor to this turkey was a good watch, not great. Curious considering written by same principle author. This is a large fall-off mainly due to a chopped up, stupid, disjointed, and hokey story that tries to rely on a dumb wish-master premise that's been done before. The direction is bad, with the dialog sometimes laughably bad. The scenes are all over the place in a bad way. The movie feels like its gone through 20 re-writes in a bad way. This is what happens when ideas become a dime a dozen - grasping for straws, or too many writers become hamstrung."
tt7126948,"Greetings again from the darkness. Some of the key elements that make Wonder Woman appealing is that she's smart, she's nice, she's dedicated to doing good, she's grounded in her history, and her use of her powers makes sense (in a comic book kind of way). Most of that holds true in filmmaker Patty Jenkins' sequel to her 2017 blockbuster WONDER WOMAN. So why did that one work so well, while this one falls short? It's not an easy question to answer, though it could be as simple as having the wrong target."
tt7126948,"Sat down with my son, we were both really looking forward to seeing this. The opening sequence, that was decent I might add, ended then the mall sequence. Oh my. He looks at me, I look at him and he said ""this is terrible"". I couldn't have agreed more. This movie is a mess. Bad CGI, story that's all over the place and so much more. At two different points he wanted to shut it off but I talked him off the ledge. I was determined to finish, no matter what. I have been known to make bad decisions."
tt7126948,"So with all the bad reviews I figured that maybe people were being drama llamas and it really couldn't be that bad - it's actually worst than that. I mean, I feel like a group of teens got together and wrote this for a school project - the plot is just so, well, absent. I do hope they make one more and redeem these characters a bit, they did not deserve this."
tt7126948,"This is, without question, one of the worst films I have seen in my life -- a paint-by-numbers approach to screenwriting, but by people who clearly can't count from one to two without getting lost. The saddest aspect here is that Kristen Wiig is utterly wasted here. Her character was the most engaging early on, but then the filmmakers don't seem to have any idea what sort of character they want her to be. What a waste of time and money."
tt7126948,What a disaster movie. Every aspect in this movie is a pure garbage.
tt7126948,"What a joke of a movie 2/10 .
It was like watching a made for TV children's movie from the 90s, bad editing, bad CGI, bad script, and the Plot was RIDICULOUS."
tt7126948,"I saw my review posted with full text and now it is gone, not even readable from my account. They are purging negative reviews. Do not buy this terrible movie!! It is not worth 2.5 hrs of your time."
tt7126948,"A visually stunning movie no doubt, good CGI work, great action coordination, and loved the costumes for Gadot and Wiig. However, the concept was almost laughable at times. The main villain was nothing more than a bumbling idiot running around granting wishes of all things. And for a movie set in the 80s, one of the greatest music decades ever, the only nod was one heavily altered version of Xanadu, missed opportunity."
tt7126948,That it's no longer the worst modern superhero film. Superman IV: Quest for Peace...you can also take a cleansing breath.
tt7126948,"Compared to the original movie that made it a surprise hit at the summer box office, this 80s set flick has a confusing plot , bad CGI, and hardly a lot of 80s music against a score that almost sounds like a final fantasy video game."
tt7126948,I DO wonder what this would've been like an hour shorter.
tt7126948,"'Wonder Woman 1984 (2020)' suffers from similar issues as its predecessor. It doesn't make a good first impression, as its opening is honestly pretty rough. Though its initial action scene has a few enjoyable moments, the first sequence that properly showcases the eponymous hero is really unconvincing and is possibly the worst one in the entire affair. Thankfully, then, the second act is considerably better than the first. Once again, a decent chunk of the film is solidly entertaining. It's a little slow (people who prefer to see Diana in her costume might be a bit disappointed), but it's perfectly fine and features quite a few compelling scenes. Perhaps surprisingly, its best elements are its characters and theme. Though it's often heavy-handed, the flick does a good job of exploring its interesting central concept, which is actually rather resonant and gives its characters something to struggle with internally. Pedro Pascal and Kristen Wiig are probably the movie's best aspects; their characters are distinct, unexpected and surprisingly believable. Pascal, especially, is a delight to watch as a charming but greedy businessman whose initially calm exterior slowly breaks down over the course of the story. Unlike its predecessor, the movie manages to successfully - and, I'll add, satisfyingly - see its theme through to its logical conclusion. Unfortunately, the film's quality drops significantly as it moves into its final act. After a fairly forced heel turn, the affair struggles to balance its human (though still overblown) stakes with its superhero action. It feels as though the final, CGI-fuelled fight is only included out of a pressure to confirm to the genre. The finale's actual conclusion brings things back down to a more relatable level, but by then most of the damage is done. Still, it's not a terrible sequence and its conclusion is actually shockingly effective. What isn't shockingly effective is the picture's denouement. This tacked-on ending (clearly a reshoot added due to the piece's pushed-back December release) is genuinely terrible, a Hallmark-esque moment that straight-up seems like a life-affirming commercial for, like, a beer or something. It's so bad that it almost sours the entire feature; you really have to remind yourself that this scene doesn't represent the quality of the overall thing. I mean, there are a few sequences that look, sound and, even, feel 'made for TV' (and one that annoyingly uses John Murphy's theme from 'Sunshine (2007)'), but nothing comes close to the cringe of the last pre-credits scene. So, overall, the film is a mixed bag. It does some things better than its predecessor, such as maintain a consistent theme and provide compelling villains, but it also does some things much worse and, even at its best, generally isn't as entertaining. However, it's not a bad picture, by any means. Frankly, some of the heavy criticism levelled towards is a bit excessive. 6/10."
tt7126948,"In the first 11 minutes, we see a child Diana having a great performance in a kind of Olympic Games of Amazons. Well, that was promising enough... Then, things change and we see for five minites adult Wonder Woman saving the they in a shopping mall. Despite some nonsense action scenes with the lasso, it seemed that the movie would have a vintage old-school superhero approach, what could also be very interesting. However, after that, the real film began as what it would be until the end: an embarassing and silly soap opera with poor script, a lot pf shallow self-help and inconsistent superpowers and magic. While both villains are ridiculous, the idea of Diana's dead lover possessing another man was even much worse! Script is not only cheesy as the worst clichÃ© romantic comedies, but also quite lazy, as the evil rock of desires makes obvious. Cheetah's uprising, the invisible plane... everything had a bad and unintelligent explanation in the story, or simply was not explained, such as the weird flight (was that Supergirl?! Is that Hawkgirl?! I thought it was a Wonder Moman movie!). To resume: awful blockbuster. Gal Gadot also looks better when she is in superpower action full of CGI than when she is actually acting."
tt7126948,Is this set in the 80's or not? Hard to tell with the inconsistent set and costumes. Disposable coffee cups like those at a gas station or Starbucks weren't around in that era. Kristen Wiig shines as always.
tt7126948,"This movie could easily lose half an hour or more, but that wouldn't help very much, the main story is ok, but the writing is quite inconsistent and the pace is terrible, after the first action scene the movie drags over one hour showing long, silly and boring scenes of the character coming and going, doing nothing.
When the main events unfold, it's quite a mess, and the characters keep running around like headless chicken.
The action is not impressive, nothing new to see.
Many things don't make any sense and I don't even want to start thinking about plotholes...
Quite a mess of a movie, it does have some good moments, but it's definitely not a good movie."
tt7126948,"... in that I can enjoy a good one, but film noir and precode are really my preferred genres. From that perspective, I don't think that this movie is nearly as bad as everybody says."
tt7126948,Just release the real one alredy i get it its a prank but its not funny i want the worthy wonder woman sequel i was peomised
tt7126948,"The first WW was a decent movie, the second installment is not.
The plot is basic, and has been done before. The setting is 1984, we get it, but really has no bearing on the story, at all. However, the movie sure made sure to show plenty of pastel colors and popped collars, because you know, the 80s.
The CGI is really bad in some places, and the action sequences are also stale and boring. This film does nothing to set up any future stories within the DCEU, or really shed any light on WW, other than the opening scene showing her as a child.
The worst part of all has to be the ending. Max Lord has to touch people to grant wishes, but at the end all he has to do is appear on TV? What!? Also, to break the wishes he granted, all a person has to do is renounce the wish. So in the end, WW really isn't needed at all."
tt7126948,... Gal Gadot And Patty Jenkins: Hold our beers.
tt7126948,"Wonder Woman 1984 is a sad turn of a superhero movie. First, it's more of a soap opera with a dash of comedy. Secondly, it is far too long. Third, the CGI is utterly scary to look at, except for the combat sequence in the White House. The plot is thin and does not comply with its own rules and we do not have to constantly be told that Barbara is sexy. They could not even credit the Smithsonian Institution properly."
tt7126948,"They need to unleash the auditors on this producer and film because, according to IMDB, this film had a budget of $200 million and yet this was the result."
tt7126948,"I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone tbh. The whole ""body borrowed"" plot points are uncomfortable and I can't imagine it being allowed if the sexes flipped."
tt7126948,"Really bad story, plot, writing; no point going any further than that. First four minutes was the best part, no wonder they used as a teaser. The movie was doomed after that due to the script."
tt7126948,"I went to a theater to see this with my family in a DOLBY THEATER so I paid very hefty price (even when I have HBO MAX and could have save the money).
Well; to be very brief. The 4 stars if for the acting. Wiig and Pascal excellent, Gadot and Pines just OK but as always charismatic."
tt7126948,So I just had to turn it off.
tt7126948,"1.- 90% of this movie is a Romance Comedy straight up from the late 80's, the other 10% is an action movie based on a comic book hero.
2.- Cristen Wigg as Cheetah might be the worst casting choice since Halley Berry as Catwoman.
3.- C.G.I. as mediocre as it can get.
4.- A lot of cringe inducing dialog
5- I am sorry for Gal Gadot, but after that Imagine viral video.... I couldn't concentrate on her performance."
tt7126948,JUST SAY NO
tt7126948,Wonder Woman 3: (dadaa) Wonder Woman vs. Cat Woman!!!!!!!!
tt7126948,This is a classic example of a poorly written movie.
tt7126948,"I enjoyed the first Wonder Woman film and this sort-of-sequel started well with an Amazonian Ben Hur type C-Gen sequence where the young Diana Prince enters a kind of super-Triathlon event only to learn from it a moral which, so far as I can recall, had no real relevance to the succeeding story where, now fully-grown, she turns up for some reason in 1984."
tt7126948,"The movie is flat, Plot holes all over the place and a ""beautiful message"" hidden somewhere in between Pedro Pascals over the top interpretation and a terrible writing"
tt7126948,We all wished for a good movie and the stone didn't work.
tt7126948,"This sequel simple doesn't have the story. The first wonder woman was much better. The plot is too crazy, making wishes with a stone and then the wishes destroy the world? Didn't get it and didn't like how they brought Chris Pine back. Not good enough story. Just a let down."
tt7126948,"This isn't the sort of film I would normally watch, but by chance I came to see it with no prior knowledge of what it's about nor how it's been generally received. I found it to be an incoherent, brash, overly-long, boring mess. A lot of ""stuff"" happened in this film, but it never felt like it mattered towards anything because character motivations weren't satisfactorily explained nor were the ramifications."
tt7126948,It's Superwoman.
tt7126948,Leaking like a sieve with plot holes aplenty as Film Editing for Dummies is dispatched to the cutting room floor and the opportunity to build on the previous excellent performances becomes a bit of a blunder.
tt7126948,"I'm going to be generous and say WW84 was at least fun. I wasn't bored, and it kept me watching with some enjoyable moments. Having said that, it is terribly underwhelming."
tt7126948,"2 1/2 hours of complete garbage. It was boring and slow, the few times there was any action it was poorly executed and the CGI isn't good at all."
tt7126948,I was really looking forward to this film. Unfortunately this script was poorly executed and written so the sequel falls short. Villains are one dimensional and it is slow and mushy almost like a drama romance with such a trite story/plot that by the short amount of action starts in bits of pieces it's almost forced and feels odd against villains that really do not pose any threat. So many cliches and huge holes in the story and characters that WWoman focuses more in her compassion and empathy than on actually why she is really in 80s reality. And Kristen Wiig character Dr Poison is yet another twisted lost persona/villain that is interesting yet confusing what is her role like many others like Maxwell Lord you never feel is a real villain at all yet WWoman wants to stop him from ... laughable threat of getting people to stop asking for wishes. It's such a terrible story that even by the last Act when the real positive message comes forth it feels like forced conjecture and more cliche antics. It's shocking that a script could be green lit with so many disconnected parts that just don't work. I honestly don't know who these people are claiming it's a masterpiece but it's definitely not even remotely close to being as good as the last one. I'm giving it a 1 Star because my friends walked out of the film and that's pretty rare esp for solid DC fans. Better luck next time and please remember it's an action film not a feel good drama romance. And enough with the silly shoe and change of clothing scenes. What's next.. WWoman asking about lip stick colors to move the story )
tt7126948,Everything is wrong in this film; it comes across as some amateur dramatics first attempt at a play. You would think they must have run out of money or changed director multiple times to end up with this mess.
tt7126948,"Dumb plot, bad special effects, uninteresting dialogue, long and boring. My wife wanted to see it, but no one in the family liked the movie. I gave it 3 stars because there are worse movies, but on the thumbs up / thumbs down scale, it is the latter."
tt7126948,"In a movie where magic is possible as is established by the wishing stone it makes no sense that WW didnt just wish her dead boyfriend alive. Instead she wishes his soul to be back and he then possesses someone else body. In the credit they only refer to that guy as handsome guy, yet in the movie must have had some sort of life, yes?
Everybody in the movie sees handsome guy, he himself see himself as handsome guy as well as was shown when he looked in the mirror.
Then they have sex and WW acknowledges that its weird to have sex while he is another mans body. Which makes her a rapist and even een physical abuser considering the adventures they take on and the risks they takes with handsome guy's body.
Her credibility as a hero have been totally diminished after this movie. In the end she doesnt renounces her wish for the sake of the life handsome guy had, but only to have her powers back? What???"
tt7126948,"Acting , BAD! ð­
Plot, WORSE! ð­
Tired Tropes, ALL OF THEM! ð­"
tt7126948,"Oh gawd, what were they (whoever) thinking! What a long, boring, load of tripe. So disappointing. Chris Pine along along with some nifty CGI were the only small redeeming things in this drama (hence 3 stars and not 1). It was barely funny, wit was entirely absent and the story line was snooze-worthy dull. A good dose of editing may have helped, but even then I'm sceptical. Only the last 40 mins is really worth watching, but even that is ruined by the writing with some really long sanctimonious diatribes. It was just awful."
tt7126948,"I love Gal Gadot. I really like Chris Pine. I hated this movie. To be entirely honest, I should say I hated the first half of the movie which was more than I could stomach. I asked my wife if I could turn it off and she was already asleep. This is something you might expect if this was sequel number 20 and they had completely run out of ideas. Not sure what I expected but this was embarrassingly bad."
tt7126948,Where to start? I'll just spill it out by the numbers.
tt7126948,"But I watched it through nonetheless just because Gal Gadot is always great as Diana and Chris Pine works well with her. But even Gal's magic starts to fade as this loser goes on and on and on. The plot and script of this movie have to be up there with the worst of all time for a major release. But to waste a talent like Gadot on this, geez, what a crime."
tt7126948,"The first movie was full of awesomeness, they took it all away this movie. I know it was set in the 80's. but some scenes were really cheesy and campy... All I can do is pray for DC."
tt7126948,Don't waste your money. My family sat down tonight all very excited to watch. No more than me. All three of my children got up and walked away from the movie within first hour and my wife had a nap. I was determined to see it through. Pretty upset I wasted $30 on this.
tt7126948,"First 15 minutes are exciting, if not highly derivative of Harry Potter. After that, oh so, so many fails. Who sets a movie in the 80s and then proceeds to get everything about the period wrong? 80s music is limited to one 30 second snatch of a Frankie Goes To Hollywood deep cut in a forgettable scene. The opening sequence set in a mall sets the tone as ridiculous and it pretty much devolves from there."
tt7126948,"We were so close. 2020, thanks to the COVID epidemic and its effect on film distribution, was very nearly the first year in ages without a single big-studio capesh-t movie, with the exception of Birds of Prey."
tt7126948,"I haven't laughed so much at a film in ages -
So thanks for that!"
tt7126948,"""Wonder Woman 1984"" was the last hope for superhero movie fans in 2020. Gal Gadot as Diana is by far the best thing about the Wonder Woman franchise. She gets a new chance at love by a magical wish and now together they need to go against Max Lord and Cheetah."
tt7126948,Very disappointed. Boring. many pointless timewasting scenes . bad acting by great actors. bad corny nonsensical script . totally illogical. The fireworks scene was a waste of time. many subliminal political messages . I had to force myself to watch til the end. The funny bits are lacking and not great. I would avoid this movie. So overrated. The story line is just very poorly made. Not great directing.
tt7126948,"First 15 minutes was the best, and literally did not contribute to the story... not one bit."
tt7126948,"This movie is utterly trash, perhaps worse than many 80's B movies. I was certainly expecting a good story line, excellent fighting action, stellar CGI, great acting, and convincing characters. What I got was a tiresome love story, villains that aren't truly dark, Toby Maguire era Spider-Man CGI, bad jokes, pedestrian level fight scenes, and a story line revolving around wishes. Diana must save the world from... wishes. You can't make this crap up. If they were going to make a movie set in 1984, then at least have a good 80's soundtrack!"
tt7126948,With Wonder Woman bringing much needed colour and verve back to DC Films.
tt7126948,"I found myself watching ""Wonder Woman 1984"" on TV the other night when my mother walked in. After I told her the title, she asked ""Didn't (Steve) die in ('Wonder Woman')""? I said yes. Then she said, very confused: ""How did he come back?"" I explained that Diana discovers a legendary crystal which grants wishes and she wished for Steve to return, and he assumes another man's body. As I was saying this, not only did I realize how utterly lame this was, I could hear the Barbara character yelling: ""LAME!"" inside my head!"
tt7126948,"I thought that the first Wonder Woman was bad, but was I ever wrong."
tt7126948,"For such a highly anticipated movie this was one of the biggest letdowns. The cgi was so obvious and overdone and the acting was cheesy. It was a struggle to get through the film. We kept waiting on it to get better, or at least some awesome fight scene, and nothing happened. Seems fitting for the year 2020. They messed up on this one."
tt7126948,Reading the reviews here has been the best part of this movie. This felt like an afternoon bad DC animation ment for 10 year olds. And that's generous... Watch it for a laugh. Don't expect single thing carried over from the first movie. ððððð
tt7126948,"I enjoyed the first movie. Gal Gadot is excellent as the golden hearted heroine in both films and is 3 of the 3 stars I gave for this stinker. Wow, what a lame story- just to crowbar in you know who it seems- why isn't someone somewhere saying no, this is rubbish! before it even gets off the ground? They tried to take what was good from the first movie but just ended up producing some crappy cheap fast-food version. McWonder Woman. I feel sorry for the actors. I remember seeing the main bad guy in the Buffy the Vampire Slayer series. So this jobbing actor gets a big-break in a blockbuster movie scenario and it's this one. Really not worth your time, watch something else."
tt7126948,"This movie was so bad I can't put into words.Not just sequel bad. Bad. I love action and fantasy, but this sequel is so bad I can no longer watch the original."
tt7126948,"This is easily one of the worst sequels ever made.The cgi in the opening scene was hideous, and it stayed that way throughout. The story was poorly written and the plot was uninteresting. Also the first scene showing WW as a child, what was that about?? Didnt we get the back story in the original, was a waste of time. Movie is filled with cliches, especially the kristen wiig character(the nerd with glasses and frumpy clothes) Until of course she mkes a wish on a rock, and bam shes loses the glasses and now shes hot. Gal Gadot is perfectly cast as WW but she cant save the bad dialogue or poor storytelling. I'd be willing to give part 3 a go if they ditch the entire creative team behind this installment."
tt7126948,"This is honestly one of the worst films I've ever seen. And no, not because I had high expectations and it was a mediocre film, but because it genuinley must have been made by children. It's honestly THAT bad."
tt7126948,"Just when I wanted to get on the DC bandwagon, they return to junk movies. I'm forced to presume Gadot got a butt-load of money acting and sorta producing this one. Hopefully she uses that influence to do better (fingers crossed). Too long with nothing of real substance. WW storyline deserves better esp after success of first film."
tt7126948,The first Wonder Woman movie was a very successful movie and proves that you can give someone who didn't have much credit in the movie world a push and make the actress a star. That's what happened for Gal Gadot who played Wonder Woman.
tt7126948,"I loved the first WW movie. It blew my mind. Mind you I am not a WW fan normally. After seeing the trailer for this new one it looked kind of crappy. When it came out reviews said it wasn't good. I finally took the leap (it's January now) and watched it, I was hoping maybe there was some redeeming thing in it. Instead I wish I could have my time back spent watching this."
tt7126948,"Silly story, weak meandering script, banal dialogue, slow pace, way too long. How on earth did this nonsense get green-lit?"
tt7126948,"This is a sequel to the 2017 Wonder Woman, set during WW1 times. This one is 1984 and the new ""war"" is an individual or two trying to take control of the whole world. That is facilitated by an ancient crystal that magically grants wishes."
tt7126948,"I loved the first Wonder Woman movie in the DCU movies and enjoyed it very much. As for the sequel I was very displeased. I felt as though it was really dragged out and didn't really for fill my want in a super hero movie. For a two and a half hour movie it was lacking. You don't see her as Wonder Woman for more than fifteen minutes in the beginning, ten minutes in the middle, and maybe twenty at the end with a very non-climatic ending at that. The love story was more of a main focal point than her actually being a superhero. All in all not pleased sad I wasted that time and definitely would never watch again."
tt7126948,Can not believe Patty Jenkins has created this feature. If Wonder Woman is a milestone then WW84 is a typical summer movie
tt7126948,Lots of people wished for a sequel to Wonder Woman. Too bad they got their wish. What a hot mess. The first half of the movie was devoted to an homage to eighties decor and fashion. As if Patty Jenkins wanted to relive her childhood. She spent more time reveling in the fashions than she did the storyline. Except for Chris Pine and Kristopher Polaha the acting was so over the top that the actors literally chewed the scenery. There was constant monumental music in the background to keep reminding you that this is a superhero movie. Except it's not. Wonder Woman is a hapless victim throughout most of the movie. Two and a half hours I can never get back.
tt7126948,"Why why why 2 hrs and 30 minutes, when there is nothing to offer. A family movie made the whole of my family so bored that we had to forward at many parts to just finish the movie. The most disappointing thing is that this movie ruined all of the charm that Gal Gadot had as Wonder Woman. This looked so fake and so bollywood."
tt7126948,"I absolutely enjoyed it!
Loved Pedro Pascal and Kirsten Wigg, they were great supporting actors.
The young Diana flashback was my favorite part, ""I wish"" to see more of that ð
And that cameo! It was awesome!"
tt7126948,"All I can say is, don't waste time on this movie. It's just a garbage movie. The story doesn't make sense, special effects are pathetic, and dialogues are weak. Watch something else."
tt7126948,"I hope I am not alone in becoming disenfranchised by superhero franchises. The Avengers finally got it right towards the end where vulnerability was finally embued their ""immortal"" cast. I can digress where how none of these movies create a true ambiguity between good and evil, but Wonder Woman boils down to just making yet another character invincible. Whereas the revitalized Dark Knight showed us a flawed Batman, the Wonder Woman series is a Superman 1.0. I won't designate a higher number as Superman has not taken off much at all either."
tt7126948,"DC did it again, this movie is really bad, 2 and a half hours of boredom, nothing happens in all that time that is worthwhile, and the things that happen have no justification."
tt10344522,"The previous reviewer complained that Rodrigo GarcÃ­a's ""Four Good Days"" didn't go far enough in depicting its subject matter."
tt10344522,I was hooked on heroin for 10 years also....and I went through everything that was depicted in this movie. So stick your misrepresentation up your ass.... Oxy users... Brilliant performances by all. Don't let these Opiate users reviews wreck watching a masterpiece.
tt10344522,This film is really touching. It tells the horrible struggles of both the addict and the family members. The story is raw and real. I think it's really worth watching.
tt10344522,"Tragic circumstances lead to recalibration of words we can take for granted. Normally, we might think of a ""good"" day as one filled with friends, family, food, and fun. But families battered by the broken promises and crushing disappointments of substance abuse may find that for them a ""good"" day determined not by what it contains but by what it does not. In ""Four Good Days,"" based on a true story, a young addict must not use drugs for four days to receive a promising treatment. ""Good,"" for her and perhaps even more for her mother, means abstaining from drugs. The word ""love"" may not get re-calibrated for addiction, but it gets modified. We speak of ""tough love."" And so, when Molly (Mila Kunis), a strung-out addict who has been through rehab and relapsed more than a dozen times, shows up at her mother's house, instead of a warm welcome, she is turned away. Molly's mother Deb (Glenn Close) leans out of the door, her stillness in contrast to Molly's hopped-up shifts of tone. She has been lied to so much and stolen from so often she believes that it is best for Molly if those around her can impose firm boundaries. But Deb wants so badly to believe her. ""Whenever I've decided to engage with her it's always been with my eyes open,"" she says. But hope always pushes to try again, even when experience has shown us it will only break our heart. To the searing pain of the addiction/self-loathing hamster wheel, where ""life is a trigger"" and it seems the only way to bear the pain and loss and shame of addiction is to keep getting high. Drugs ruin lifes, and relationships, the only thing to do is surround yourself with people that support you, and love you. Family is the only thing that means a goddamn, you'll learn that. You've always got a reason! But it's always someone's else's fault!? At some point in your life, you are going to have to take responsibility."
tt10344522,Coming from someone who has worked in the addiction field in just about every capacity as well as dealt with it in my personal life I feel this is a very accurate depiction of addiction. From the conflicted mother trying not to enable her kid but not being able to trust a word that comes out of her mouth. To the addict who wants to get clean but continues to struggle despite the disgust she has for her addiction. It's so accurate it makes me cringe. Phenomenal acting. The mother trying to control every aspect of the addicts life and just falling short is just way too accurate.
tt10344522,MIla looked battered & bruised; even knowing it's just a movie I still felt sorry for her. A good portrayal of how drugs can destroy a person & possibly their family. Would have liked to have seen more the direct physical/mental effects while actively engaged in her menu of drugs rather than just the post glimpses of effects & withdrawal.
tt10344522,"I can tell you think brings to light, very accurately, the balance between an addict trying to get clean and needing support, and not having any trust from those that can provide it. It's so accurate, so balanced, and ultimately demonstrates the broad impact that addiction has on everyone in the addict's universe. And....shut up MEG! ð"
tt10344522,"This is a beautiful emotional touching movie. It tackles a serious topic, that we've seen a lot in previous films, but it's still interesting and important to watch. The story is beautiful, sad, well written and unfolds beautifully. Performances by Glenn Close and Mila Kunis are both superb."
tt10344522,This movie is great. It has great acting and a storyline. I don't understand people who rate movie like this one poorly. Give it a honest try.
tt10344522,"I have read a lot of these reviews and I just wanted to add my opinion. Not all addicts are the same. What works for one might not work for another. But as a former user of opioids, I want to say that Subutex (buprenorphine) is a life saver. If only it was more accessible to addicts, so many lives would be saved. One pill can keep you from getting high for 72 hours and it can also take away the unbelievable pain addicts experience when withdrawing from narcotics. It is also much safer than something like methadone. Unfortunately, it can be hard to find a doctor that is licensed to provide this medication and it can be expensive. But I have been on it now for quite some time and it has kept me from relapsing. I'm not saying I don't have cravings. But taking the Subutex every day makes it impossible to get high even if I did slip up. One more thing I wanted to add. Opioid addiction can cause bad teeth just like meth addiction can. When you're too high to take care of your oral hygiene, it doesn't really matter which drug made you that way."
tt10344522,Based on true story. Great acting and great script. Definitely brought tears in my eyes while watching this movie.
tt10344522,"I had tears in my eyes from the beginning of this movie. When it was over the flashes from my past were going through my head. My first thought "" I have to have my mother watch this with me, she cannot see this without me there""! Now, it was not always that way, see I became clean from using literally EVERY I could get my hands on and our relationship suffered tremendously. My only true love from the first time ( I didn't know what it was) HEROIN. It was everything! My love, soul, heartbreak, emotional blanket, my lover, my kiss, my pain, I mean it was EVERYTHING! This story isn't about her getting clean in my eyes, it's about all the pain that happens when you are the parent or the child and have seen this first hand or been there. I got sober at 18...almost 19. My mother and I today are so amazing but I still sometimes look at her and have to stop myself from tearing up. I put her into actual living hell. I'm 40 years old now. I haven't touched heroin once since the day I woke up and decided that was it. This movie moved me in so many ways.....the end."
tt10344522,"Very different from what Mila Kunis usually does but she pulled this off perfectly. The cast did well to make it believable which was essential because it's based on a true story. It's really worth a watch, I don't think it'll make you cry but it is a touching movie and it gives you an idea of what drug addiction costs victims and people around them."
tt10344522,"This is a great attempt and Kunis , Close, and Root are magnificent."
tt10344522,"Greetings again from the darkness. Drug addiction provides bountiful harvesting for emotional message movies, though I'll admit to some difficulty in relating to the subject matter. Writer-director Rodrigo Garcia (ALBERT NOBBS, 2011) has worked with co-writer Eli Saslow to adapt Saslow's 2016 Washington Post article, ""How's Amanda: A story of truth, lies and American Addiction"". It's an all-too-common tale of how addiction ruins lives and tears families apart. If not for two strong lead performances, Garcia's latest movie would be just 'another log on the fire'."
tt10344522,"I am a crisis/detox behavioral health technician and I believe this movie hit the nail on the head. I work with all kinds of drug addicts, patients and co-workers that were addicts. Most of which are really close friends."
tt10344522,"Lighthearted, but gripping tale of a drug addict (Mila Kunis) trying to come clean with the help of her mother (Glenn Close)."
tt10344522,"The reviews here and way harsh. I found this understatedly powerful, heartful and true. It really hits home, with some prime acting from the two and beautifully shot."
tt10344522,"I am an addict in recovery. Also had 12 detox, many therapie and most importantly, now I'm doing the 12 step program, which eventually still helps me today.. Recovery is not about getting a shot and your out. I've used the same stuff she got injected with,but that didn't work for me. It was her will to get better that helped her."
tt10344522,"This movie is about addiction and its effects on the user and his/her family. Plain and simple, addiction is addiction, and everyone caught up in the semantics of which drug has which effect, that is not the point of this important film. A standing ovation for Close and Kunis who captured the complicated roles a caregiver and an addict share. Seems like many of us have played these roles on one side or the other. It is nice to be validated, and for those suffering from addiction, keep up the fight!"
tt10344522,"How could a loving mother turn her daughter away from her doorstep? Well,, ask the parent of a drug addict."
tt10344522,"My Review - Four Good Days
My Rating 6.5"
tt10344522,"'Four good days' is nothing if not a vehicle for Mila Kunis and Glenn Close. Whatever the size or tone of the parts, both are incredible actors and have demonstrated their skills time and again. This is easily the least glamorous role Kunis has ever taken on, and Close has likewise had few roles that seemed so down to earth. Both wield strong nuance and depth in their performances, realizing Molly and Deb with every ounce of emotion and range they possess. It's a joy to watch them here, and gratifyingly, they dominate the screen at almost all times. To that point, commendations as well to the makeup, hair, and wardrobe departments for their fine work in actualizing these characters."
tt10344522,"Although the actress is portraying a very bad side of addiction reviewers need to remember this is after 10 years of heavy use. Other reviews on here are wrong she wasn't just on opioids,...she did all sorts of drugs. So no, this doesn't just represent opioid addiction. This movie is a perfect example of how easy it is to go from a prescription or small weekend habit that ""helps"" you through your day to, throwing your entire life away trying and doing anything to get high. Sure some addicts aren't as bad off and have more control to the point you'd never even know they were an addict. However, the point of this movie is to show all of the extremely dark sides of addiction and how addiction starts. They did a good job showing the multiple factors that can play a role in addiction like, doctors who carelessly give these drugs out, how your mental health can make it a struggle to stay sober, and how family traumas truly can cause someone to go down a very bad path. Most importantly they show how much you can lose and how hard it is to get clean again. Not to mention how hard is will be to regain trust from those you crossed in active addiction. I see people making remarks about her appearance in the movie not being accurate compared to her main drug of choice. I strongly disagree. I watched friends loose their teeth in a matter of 4 years from pain pill use alone. They had poor hygiene and didn't ever eat leading to vitamin deficiency. That's why withdrawals can be so painful the drug masks the feeling of pain but once you come off not only are your receptors out of wack but your entire body is in excruciating pain from not taking care of yourself. Addiction looks different for everyone . This movie is not an every case scenario but like I said it does show what most severe cases look like. Why do you think so many people end up on the streets from drugs? You can't tell me ALL of those people have noone in their life that would help if they were good honest people. Most likely their family/friends have tried and time and time again to save them. All while they lie scheme and steal from you. Sometimes people have no choice but to turn their back until they get clean and become the good person they once were. They also show how difficult it is to get treatment. Overall, in a world like today this is a great movie for anyone who has struggled with addiction or currently struggling. Children can even benefit from this movie as long as it's followed with a serious talk at the end where the discussion is open for any questions they may have. Children need to be made aware of these things before they are teenagers. Its way too easy to get your hands on drugs and become addicted. Most of the time the parent doesn't know until it's too late and their child is gone whether it's physically or metaphorically. Addiction is a terrible disease."
tt10344522,"This movie flew under the radar. Glenn Close is the mom to Mila Kunis - a mom herself who has spent 14 stints in rehab and now is back at Glenn's door. In hopes of being able to take a shot that will make her body unable to get high again, they're trying to make it through 4 days until her body is clean enough. A good treatment of the agony of addiction."
tt10272386,"This movie was shot in May 2019 just a few months before the COVID-19 pandemic was recognized. The writer-director says he wrote this with Anthony Hopkins, who was 81, in mind. The movie has a number of well established actors but the story's impact depends on Hopkins and he achieves this as very few might be able to do."
tt10272386,"This movie brings you inside the mind of someone losing their memories and recognition of those around them. In another genre, what happens here could just as well take place in a horror film. The fascinating thing about the story as it unfolds is that as the viewer, there comes a point where you begin to question whether what you're seeing is what the principal character is experiencing, or whether it's a figment of Anthony's (Anthony Hopkins) imagination. The distinction between his reality and the reveries that make up his daily existence sort of blend together in a way that confound the senses. Hopkins is extraordinary in the role, and if this is his last chance to earn an Oscar for Best Actor, then it's a darn good one in a field with some significant competition. Olivia Colman as Anthony's struggling daughter expresses all the concern and frustration that comes with being the primary caregiver for her dementia stricken father, and there are somber moments in the picture when you want to cry along with her over the hopelessness of both his and her situation. As a harbinger of what might happen to anyone as we all approach those senior twilight years, the film can be a depressing experience, only somewhat mitigated by the care and concern that dedicated health care workers are able to provide in an institutional setting. As tender and comforting as the closing scene is, it's one that will break the heart of anyone who's been through a similar experience."
tt10272386,This is one of the hardest movie reviews I've ever had to write in my life.
tt10272386,"I cannot say what I want to say about this film without spoilers, so please don't read on if you want to find what happens in the film as it unfolds."
tt10272386,"I haven't seen the play on which ""The Father"" is based, (or indeed the other two plays in Florian Zeller's trilogy on the family), but as cinematic adaptations go this is as good as it gets. Taking place almost entirely on a single set, this is an actor's piece of the highest order and its linchpin is a magnificent performance from Anthony Hopkins as ""The Father"" of the title, a man suffering from advanced dementia and perhaps, both in Hopkins's performance and Zeller's treatment of the subject, this will come to be seen as the definitive film on dementia as anyone with personal experience can testify."
tt10272386,"... the days get shorter, darkness encroaches, the past begins to fade and confusion reigns. A remarkable piece of cinema, profoundly performed and presented, both touching and terrifying and relevant - your own experience uniquely yours but one you'll never forget... until."
tt10272386,"Give Anthony Hopkins the Oscar on April 26. He gives you the best performance of the decade. An old man with dementia loses his ties to reality. His mind deteriorates, and reality stops making any sense. This movie will haunt you, especially if you have a relative with dementia. Such a heartbreaking movie. ABSOLUTELY the best movie of the year and the best performance of the year by Hopkins."
tt10272386,"The Father couldn't be more realistic when talking about Alzheimer's disease. I've seen my grandfather walking that path. He was a smart man but once the dementia kicked in he was barely recognizable, which was a hard thing to witness when you knew him as the intellectual he was. The Father just nailed this subject, bringing back so many memories, memories we would rather forget but that you can't. Living with a loved one with this disease isn't easy at all, certainly not when that person sometimes doesn't remember who you are. I didn't knew Anthony Hopkins won an Oscar for his role, but after watching this movie I can only say it's highly deserved. It's probably one of his better performances ever, and that at 83 years old. The Father isn't a movie that will give you a lot of joy, it's sad and scary but certainly worth watching. Nobody wants to have a loved one suffering from dementia, it's a nightmare to live with. I remember my grandfather starting to smoke a cigarette like it was a thing he always did and that whilst he stopped more than forty years ago. I remember him telling me he was going crazy after asking me the same question for the twentieth time in barely an hour. He knew it was all going downhill, he knew he was a burden to everybody, and that must hurt when you are still that little bit lucid to understand that. I watched several movies about dementia but this one is just the most realistic. It's sad but that's life, everybody should watch it so they can be prepared if the disease ever would hit a loved one."
tt10272386,"This is the kind of movie that may feel you uncomfortable, it is disturbing but that will make you stuck to the screen. It shows the kind of situation that may concern millions of us, now or in the future, or also in the past, about one of our relatives. Of course Anthony Hopkins gives a more than brilliant performance and the most unusual is to lead the audience in some kind of a maze, the audience who can have the feeling to be tricked. Anyway, I warn some audiences against this beautiful and powerful stage movie, some audiences who could have a father or mother suffering of Alzheimer disease. It could be very painful to watch. But there were many other movies speaking of this. However this one has something special, I have not yet found excatly what. I derseves to be seen again. And again, especially if you lose memory...."
tt10272386,Wow. This story is expertly crafted that I just don't know what is real and what isn't. Amazing acting too.
tt10272386,"One of my all time favorite movies is Charlie Kaufman's Synecdoche, New York which narrates the ever deteriorating world around a playwright bordering on reality and insanity. And Florian Zeller's The Father is the closest I've seen that captures the insanity of the decaying mind, but told through the apparatus of a very real and universal issue."
tt10272386,This is a powerful film.
tt10272386,"After his previous carer leaves the daughter of an octogenarian, Anthony, organises a new carer for him. However, to Anthony everything is confusion: faces change, one day his daughter Anne is moving to Paris, the next day she's not, is this his flat or not? And why doesn't his other daughter visit him anymore?"
tt10272386,"Anthony Hopkins gives an amazing performance, one of the best in his career, is hard to decide who deserve more the best actor between him and Chadwick Boseman, i know is controversial, but i would vote for Hopkins."
tt10272386,"I started watching the film not knowing what to expect. Then, throughout the film, it was twists and turns, one after the other... so beautifully and elegantly done. Anthony Hopkins was superb, an absolute masterpiece of excellent acting. Just amazing..."
tt10272386,Anthony Hopkins gives a towering performance and joined the ranks of multi-Oscar winning actors in this harrowing film.
tt10272386,"The Father might be the saddest film I've ever seen. With a heartbreaking powerhouse of a performance, Anthony Hopkins is at his absolute best. This puts you in the shoes of a man whose mind is deteriorating. I fully recommend that everyone see this movie. As great as it is, it is not one I want to rewatch anytime soon."
tt10272386,"Dementia is a terrible disease. It's not something I'm interested in seeing depicted on screen. I've already seen enough of that. ""Amour"" (2012), with it likewise being claustrophobically isolated to an apartment and although it involves a stroke, especially comes to mind. Anticipating it was a depressingly realistic slice-of-life drama, I wasn't enthusiastic about seeing this Awards-winner, ""The Father,"" from a playwright turned first-time movie director. Fortunately and surprisingly, I don't think it's that, and one would be well advised to see it before reading reviews for it, including this one. I'm not familiar with the writer-director's original play that this is an Anglicization of, ""Le PÃ¨re,"" nor the French film already made of it, ""Floride"" (2015), so I don't know how much of it was always of design or if anything is original here. I mean, ""they don't even speak English there."" Regardless, that ""The Father"" may come across as what I feared it was--and what others seem to discuss it as--is because we may forget genres when introduced to their entries in unpredictable ways. But, remember, ""The Father"" is a mind-game film, a puzzle picture."
tt10272386,"Anthony refuses to accept any help from his daughter Anne, or any family members, Anthony's confusion increases, he's battling dementia."
tt10272386,"Anthony (Anthony Hopkins) is elderly and living in his flat. His daughter Anne (Olivia Colman) keeps dropping by to check he is OK. But is this right? Strange things keep happening to him, from losing his watch to having strange people turn up at the flat. For Anthony is battling against dementia, and reality and fantasy are not quite as distinct as they once were."
tt10272386,"""The Father"" is a contemporary example of what was formerly called ""Kitchen Sink Drama""--a gritty slice of life unvarnished and raw. Sir Anthony Hopkins delivers a magisterial performance as a man suffering from dementia and occasionally recognizing that he is a prisoner in his own mind."
tt10272386,"Thank you, Anthony Hopkins, for giving me an eternal fear of forgetting everyone and everything I hold dear."
tt10272386,"This movie is mind-blowing. Not only does it give you the perspective of a mind that has devolved into dementia, it creatively immerses you in their moment-to-moment thoughts and experiences through the repeating confusing scenes, changing context, strange faces, disappearing furniture, etc. Now who could convincingly portray an old man who has lost his mind through an acting performance that showcases the opposite of dementia? None other than Sir Anthony Hopkins! Here, we have this veteran actor at 82 years old who could very well be a victim of dementia himself at that ripe old age. Instead, he is firing at all cylinders, giving us this heartwarming performance of a lifetime making us convinced that he really has dementia, but the act of doing so just proves he is at the top of his game with elite-level acting. Who would've thought that after 30 years of his legendary Hannibal Lecter, he would top himself with this one? I look forward to more Anthony Hopkins films to come!"
tt10272386,"I remember that there was a bit of an outrage - not about the movie itself, but about the Academy Award Anthony Hopkins was given too. Some felt that Chadwick Bosman was meant to get it. Chadwick Bosman surely deserved an Oscar - but the outrage was way too late and not really helping anyone. Chadwick would have deserved an Oscar for his performance in the ""Get up"" movie (his James Brown personification was ... just awesome and spot on), but everyone who was against the decision, must not have seen the Father. Because Anthony Hopkins is just so good in it, there is no doubt he deserved this Oscar he got."
tt10272386,"""Why do you keep looking as if there's something wrong? Everything's fine."""
tt7846844,"The acting was very well done and charming. There were a lot of good moments and some beautiful shots. Millie Bobby Brown is solid in her role. Also, the fight scenes were well executed. The supporting cast was largely excellent. But, the writing came up short. The beginning was one long voiceover and rather dull. Enola's looks at the camera were fun but too much of the story was told that way. They violated the ""show, don't tell' tenet of all good fiction. Also, if you're a Sherlock Holmes fan, you might be somewhat turned off by this movie. If you're Millie Bobby Brown fan though, you'll probably love it. I still like her character in this - it was good to see her have an opportunity to play someone so different from Eleven on Stranger Things."
tt7846844,"Enola Holmes is absolutely wonderful, quirky and charming. You'll absolutely love it, unless you're a Sherlock Holmes fan, then it quickly looses its charms. They basically change every character completely to fit the story, rendering them unrecognisable. But, it's made for young teen girls and they will love it. I should also add, that Henry Cavill is one of the worst Sherlock Holmes, I've ever seen. I genuinely like him as an actor, but in this case I think he was terribly miscast."
tt7846844,"This is the movie I wish I had at 15. This isn't about Sherlock Holmes. It's not about solving a mystery or surprising the audience. It's about a teenage girl finding out who she is. It was charming, funny, wonderfully acted, aesthetically pleasing, and sweet. If you are a grown man criticizing it, Back off. This wasn't made for you. Or me. This was made for 15 yro girls. And the fifteen year old girl in me LOVED it."
tt7846844,"Interesting premise, interesting setting, good actors, terrible writing.
The plot is all over the place."
tt7846844,"I must have watched a different movie then some of these viewers. This was better than a 1,2,point movie..It was a cute movie. Millie has become a really good actress. This was not a Sherlock Holmes movie..is was a movie of the fictional little sister of Holmes. I thought is was very well acted and I even loved how she would speak to the audience, that was a good touch....this was very much worth seeing. I enjoyed it."
tt7846844,"I acknowledge that I'm not the target audience for this movie, but come on, it still could have been more entertaining than it was."
tt7846844,"Mille Bobby Brown is excellent, Sam Claflin is extraordinary and Henry Cavil is being Henry Cavil. The Production is great, the story is heart warming but the mystery is not to much.
I cant wait to see the spin off with Henry Cavil as Sherlock Holmes."
tt7846844,"I enjoyed this movie and I am someone who is in the center politically. I sometimes think woke culture is pushed too much, but not in this movie. In my opinion this movie is about being your own person. I loved the acting and had no problems accepting the story."
tt7846844,It sort of tries to be too many things at once.
tt7846844,"Without much of a mystery to solve, this young Holmes comes across more like a junior-level Wonder Woman: intelligent and highly trained yet puzzled by this unfamiliar, unfair world of men."
tt7846844,"Rarely nowadays can we find a film that everyone in the family can watch together but happily this is one of those films. Charming characters, good story, action, lovely landscapes...
Just a very enjoyable film...."
tt7846844,"How wonderful would this film have been for teatime on Boxing Day, it very much has that cosy, family viewing vibe."
tt7846844,"I'll start by saying this is not one for me. Its pitched squarely at teenage girls. My concern is the rather nasty underlying message about men, that's part of the baggage."
tt7846844,"I agree with one of the people who posted here. People very often view a film not for what it is, but what they either think it should be or want it to be. As the poster pointed out, this isn't a Quentin Tarantino film. It's well-done family entertainment about the adventures of a young woman, Enola Holmes, as she sets out to find her missing mother."
tt7846844,"What a shocker, another 'Men are BAD' movie. The top review says ' If you are a grown man criticizing it, back off'. I'm a grown woman, grew up in the 60's and 70's, and I'm criticizing it. The new world order is to portray all (or even the majority of) men as controlling towards women and girls, which is simply not the truth. It hurts to see society is swallowing this load of crap hook line and sinker. To be told you need to be empowered is to take away the power you already have."
tt7846844,"This movie was a lot of fun... I'm a fan of the action packed Guy Ritchie Sherlock Holmes films, and this felt a lot like a PG-13 version of those films... It's rated M for the action sequences, which were well done, but definitely had that PG feel to it. The production design, acting, soundtrack, and pacing of the story were all very good... I would have scripted the final 15 minutes differently, but it still worked in the scheme of the plot and the motivations of the main characters. Millie Bobby Brown is a great young actor and is again the corner stone of this film. A new take on a classic, just enjoy it for what we enjoy films for... A fun, engaging story..."
tt7846844,"The storyline was a bit bland and disjointed, a lot going on but no substance. The acting was fairly good and the costumes were great. The looking into the camera narration was borderline creepy and didn't add anything to the story."
tt7846844,"If there was one thing the cinematic universe probably didn't need it was yet another iteration of the Sherlock Holmes universe but proving once more Hollywood the film world in general seems to be content resurrecting and re-imaging properties until they are no longer filled with any life left in them, along comes Enola Holmes."
tt7846844,"Inevitably as I'm not in the target teen market for this film I ended up hating it, but then I'm a guy approaching it as a fan of Conan Doyle and authentic screen depictions of Sherlock Holmes, not this modernist teen fantasy version. And this film is pure fantasy, not even attempting to look into the moral codes and etiquette of Victorian society, but instead throwing in random disparate elements including all-female ju jitsu clubs and the sight of a random artistocrat cavorting around the countryside with a female minor. The plot hinges on a ridiculous, underwritten and uninteresting mystery, while the cast is littered with familiar faces ill at ease in their roles: Helena Bonham Carter, whose entire role is rather pointless; Henry Cavill, who couldn't be more miscast if he tried. The only decent performances come from Burn Gorman (once more typecast as an assassin) and the excellent Millie Bobby Brown, whose charisma and exuberance shine off the screen."
tt7846844,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film. All of my preconceived notions of this movie were tossed out from the start. I'm so glad she's not a Mary Sue, with her flaws. 16 year olds weren't here children at the turn of the 20th century, so it's refreshing to showcase this. At the same time, they made an error, in my opinion. They made mention of the Ritz hotel, but it wasn't opened until 1906. Otherwise, everybody did a good job. Breaking the 4th wall was a nice touch as well."
tt7846844,"All I can say Millie has a great future a head, she was brilliant the entire movie is based on her great performance and the entire cast and crew did a great job to show how awesome actor Millie is."
tt7846844,"If you enjoy anacronystic casting and a feminist agenda crowbarred into Victorian setting, you'll love this. I don't, so I didn't."
tt7846844,"I read quite a few reviews forsaking this movie. While I understand their standings, I don't think they understood the movie. There were several revolutionary women during the time of the movie and before it. Shall I remind people of Joan of Arc?! Anyway, back to the movie. The background was about ENOLA HOLMES NOT SHERLOCK. There are plenty of movies about him even if she did not exist in Sir Arthur's books. While the movie had undertones of feminism, it was mainly about a coming of age story, where society expects you to conform to their standards instead of being an individual, much like today. Also, when Millie was talking to the audience it is a real thing called Breaking The Fourth Wall, which is a term for the invisible wall that exists between the world the play or movie in this case is in, and the audience."
tt7846844,"Sherlock Holmes ... has a sister? Interesting and why not? I know some may have issues with that, but think about all the girls who know can have some fun too. And that is the target audience. Young female viewers. That doesn't mean you can't have fun watching this, if you are not in that specific demographic. It just means, you are more likely to enjoy it, if you are."
tt7846844,"I should start by noting that I've never read any of the books depicting Sherlock Holmes's younger sister. In fact, I've never read any of Arthur Conan Doyle's original novels. Coming into ""Enola Holmes"" completely unaware of its background, I was pleased. The point is to be entertaining, and the movie is just that. In a role quite different from Eleven on ""Stranger Things"", Millie Bobby Brown plays Enola as a vivacious girl out to challenge the Victorian era's gender norms while solving a mystery. It's nothing spectacular, but will be enjoyable if you have nothing else to watch."
tt7846844,"I tend to loathe films that disdain my intelligence and take me for a ten year old child and this film unhesitatingly jumps into that category. From telling me 8 billion times that ""enola"" is alone in reverse, or reducing Sherlock Holmes to an alpha-male, sturdy dude whose job is to lay beside a tree like those in Greek classical paintings, or citing London as the center of civilization, this film offended my brain in so many ways that I wished it would end anytime now."
tt7846844,"That was a GREAT watch. A sophisticating, interesting and inspiring movie. I have been avoiding this movie thinking that it would be another floppy Netflix film but I was thankfully wrong. It was fun and interesting to watch. It is sophisticating because of the way they all speak, especially the main characters, the way they do things and how productive everyone used to be before. A poetic and good movie you would not want to miss because it will teach you a lot of things. Thank you Netflix and everyone who worked hard for this movie."
tt7846844,I really wanted to love this movie.
tt7846844,Don't watch it as a next Sherlock Holmes. Watch it as a fun story for teenagers with great acting.
tt7846844,"Millie Bobby Brown, along with a really nice cast, is quite charming and drives this story well. Breaking the wall to the audience creates a welcome distraction and adds to the quirky fun you will have with this film. Because the film is fun at most times, if you manage to ignore some plot elements which just seem superficially thought through and so many inaccuracies about the period. One thing that I find striking is that Netflix seems to follow a certain diversity policy about casting. Making sure to show as many as possible people with non-white ethnic backgrounds in a Victorian setting is plainly silly though. Politically this works for me being a firm believer in equal opportunities, but in art? Would you make a film about Malcolm X with a lot of white guys around the main character? So, why does Lestrade for instance now have to have a different ethnic background? Yes, it is fantasy, so why bother you might ask. Rightly so, ignore it. In the meantime I will dream of a world, where the colour of your skin, your gender and background really does not matter."
tt7846844,40 mins in and nothings happened. Who wrote this drivel?
tt7846844,Based on a series of Young Adult novels that introduced a younger sister of Sherlock Holmes.
tt7846844,"Millie Bobby Brown is super-cute and charming, that's the strongest point of Enola Holmes (including that talking to the cam technique). The rest is a rather p.c.-burden dull story with a solid production. Maybe young ones will like it (and that's I guess the target audience for the adventures of Sherlock's younge sister), I was rather slightly bored. Most Sherlock Holmes movies I know, not only the old classics (Basil Rathbone!) and the new ones with Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law alike, including Young Sherlock Holmes and the Pyramid of Fear (watch if you don't know that one!) are superior to this ""Tomb Raidered"" version (not those good ones with Angelina but the ""modern"" interpretation with Alicia Vikander). My rating is a 5 but one point I added only for the charming performance of Millie Bobby Brown."
tt7846844,"This film stirred up a lot of drama on release and got a bad reputation for it. Much of the noise centered on the historical reimagining that the filmmakers reveled in, which many reviewers took offense to, while another factor that offended viewers was Cavill's portrayal of Sherlock Holmes as both polite and all-too fallible. Both of these issues are unfounded."
tt7846844,"A waste of time to watch, a waste of money for the investors, another waste from Netflix. When are there going to be some descent productions to watch on a Netflix?"
tt7846844,"Making established male characters like Sherlock Holmes look dumb so that your new, female character looks super-smart and capable is the laziest screenwriting possible. Dear feminists and wokists, please invent your own characters and keep your dirty hands off established male characters."
tt7846844,"Some of the reviewers here seem to be under the impression that this is a Sherlock Holmes story. It is not. It is about a hitherto unknown teenage sister of his, and the tone is a bit more like ""Young Sherlock Holmes"" than ""The Hound of the Baskervilles."" It is a YA adventure about a girl searching for her identity while avoiding the normal fate of a young woman in Victorian England. While evading her brothers Mycroft and Sherlock, Enola Holmes stumbles across a missing viscount and is torn between solving his mystery and that of her vanished mother. Millie Bobbie Brown carries the film well and Henry Clavell appears just often enough to remind us of Sherlock's connection with Enola. There is little true deduction but some word puzzles and a brisk enough pace to keep the kids interested. It's a fun evening's entertainment for the whole family."
tt7846844,"I've seen many people have disliked the film because of ""historical inaccuracies"" and it's feminist ideas. I must respectfully say, as much as I respect your opinions, you've missed the point of the film entirely."
tt7846844,"I've seen many people have disliked the film because of ""historical inaccuracies"" and it's feminist ideas. I must respectfully say, as much as I respect your opinions, you've missed the point of the film entirely."
tt7846844,"A really fun film, perfect for family movie nights. Millie Bobby Brown is a fantastic actress, it really impressed me that she produced this film- I'm looking forward to her next one.
The plot was good, the characters are likable, the message was strong, and the mystery engaging. I would recommend it."
tt7846844,"Annoying AF, and badly written. The constant 4th-Wall breaks by Enola destroys the narrative, the pace, it's condescending, and becomes annoying, irritating."
tt7846844,"This young woman has a great future, she has talent and charisma. The film is entertaining and beautiful to watch. Well done Netflix"
tt7846844,"Pay no attention to the negative reviews. These people have no joy in their lives. Just sit back, relax and enjoy this well crafted, well executed and terrifically acted little romp in the countryside."
tt7846844,"Extremely cute, very teen, but the narrative and all the development is captivating, a point for the writer, she brought Sherlock in a youthful, adorable female version ..."
tt7846844,You could tell this would be about a Mary Sue character like in which it's Enola Holmes. Somehow she's gifted with every ability & smarter then her brothers. Unwatchable
tt7846844,"Both Sherlock and Mycroft are out of character, incompetent and the movie portrays them as arrogant misogynists. Neither Sherlock nor Mycroft recognize their little sister when they reach the station. This is Sherlock Holmes who can tell you what you had for breakfast last week and Mycroft whose genius surpasses that of Sherlock can't tell who their sister is? I'm not buying it. If they wanted to make Enola the hero then fine but at least don't distract the audience by directly talking to them, winking, or explaining everything. Almost all the attention is placed upon Enola, and they still drop the ball in character building. The Holmes brothers are useless and it is quite obvious that Mycroft has a secret (yet not so secret) love interest for the abusive teacher Miss Harrison. In spite of what the writers want you to think, Enola Holmes just isn't Sherlock Holmes. The storytelling is mediocre at best and the sheer amount of unnecessary scenes is staggering that most of it doesn't make logical sense. The fight scenes are comical and the villain who fights Enola is so one dimensional. Enola is obviously intelligent and possesses a vast amount of knowledge, but in the end, she didn't solve the case. She didn't solve anything without Sherlock's help and yet she gets the credit."
tt7846844,"Pretty much entirely about "" Im a strong independent woman"" and ""men are pigs"". Ruined a potentially good movie for political statements."
tt7846844,"Take a dash of eye candy, mix it with a heaping spoon of gorgeous lighting, cupful of outstanding camera work and a pinch of well made special effects. Let it simmer while admiring the smell of perfection. Now toss in a bucketful of misandry, stir in a pound of indoctrination and top it off with a gallon of ridiculousness. Shake it, don't stir. Make sure to wear a gas mask."
tt7846844,"I won't say anything more than that I enjoyed this very much, I found it old but fresh at the same time and I want more of it really soon!!!"
tt7846844,"Henry Cavill with his perfectly wavy hair is enigmatic enough to play Sherlock. Millie Bobby Brown, is the perfect casting for a quirky Enola."
tt9620292,"I've seen many comments written by men about ""Promising Young Woman"" complaining that the film doesn't go far enough, that the protagonist doesn't punish her victims enough, and that basically they would have been more satisfied by the film if the confrontations in it had ended in blood baths. These comments seem to be written without acknowledging in the slightest the irony of complaining that a film criticizing the aggressiveness of men isn't violent enough."
tt9620292,Wow - an acting masterclass from Carey Mulligan. And if this film can make one person think twice about taking advantage of someone who can't defend themself it has done it's job. But it's a lot more than a film that sends a powerful message. It is sinister entertainment at its best. Wonderful.
tt9620292,"It is a bit slow moving and less exciting than the trailer suggested, but it was a very unique premise for a movie and it was done quite well. The ending was a shock!"
tt9620292,I reckon it is or will be easy to dismiss what happens here for some. Unfortunately that does not make the things that are depict in here untrue. From a male perspective you may see different valid points throughout this ... you may feel that certain things do not apply to you. And maybe they don't - that doesn't mean that they don't exist. I know it feels like I'm repeating myself ... something the movie does avoid.
tt9620292,"Best thing about this movie is, it doesn't try to be clever or something it's not. Or maybe it's Carey Mulligan. Can't decide. It's a straight forward no nonsense revenge thriller that isn't like I spit on your grave or rather Hard Candy (which I expected it to be). It's just a very simple collective of 5 part story told cohesively and many people (on both ends and in middle) will find relatable."
tt9620292,"About mid-way into the movie I had to come to the conclusion that Cassie (Carey Mulligan) was dealing with mental illness in a way that stoked her necessity for revenge against those who humiliated her best friend Nina while in medical school ten years prior. Somehow she internalized some sense of guilt over Nina's death, even though she wasn't at the particular party where Nina got drunk and subsequently raped. It's not made clear how Nina died, but one assumes that she committed suicide as a result of the trauma she suffered with an inability to carry on. What cinched the mental illness idea for me was when she stopped her car in the middle of the road and took a lug wrench to the guy's truck who was taunting her for his inconvenience. The reaction there was over the top and out of proportion, even if the driver was a jerk. There was also that comment from Cassie's mom (Jennifer Coolidge) to the detective investigating her later disappearance when she said that Cassie was 'getting better'."
tt9620292,I watched a lot of films in 2020 (167 to be exact) and gave only one of them a perfect 10/10 score. It took exactly one film in 2021 to match that. A sign of good things ahead hopefully. 'Promising Young Woman' is one of those rare treats of a film where you simply don't want it to end. Every aspect of it is perfect. Here's the kicker though - I couldn't wait to find out who the writer/director was afterwards. To my astonishment it was a debut effort from Emerald Fennell. Incredible stuff.
tt9620292,"The imdb description reads ""A young woman, traumatized by a tragic event in her past, seeks out vengeance against those who crossed her path."" This is completely accurate, and yet is a superficial description. Yes, this is a movie about a woman attempting to create justice where none exists, but it's also about a deeply traumatized woman desperately doing things to give her a sense of control. This is why it's not a good criticism to say that what Cassie's doing doesn't make sense. It's true (like the IMDB description is true) but it's also the point. Cassie isn't Batman, and this isn't a cleverly thought-out system to make a better world. Cassie is broken but very smart and resourceful, and she is treating her inner wounds in an external way."
tt9620292,"Emerald Fennell's Oscar-winning ""Promising Young Woman"" is the perfect movie for the MeToo era. Carey Mulligan stars as the protagonist, who lures sexual predators into unpleasant situations."
tt9620292,"Emerald Fennell's sexual assault/vengeance comedy with a badass female lead played by Carey Mulligan is wickedly cunning, sadistically hilarious and shockingly unpredictable. Promising Young Woman may be a very glossy looking comedy with bits of romance, entertaining conversations, solid jokes and an incredibly original concept, but whilst there's a slightly light-hearted side to it, it also comes across as one of the most necessary films of the year."
tt9620292,"Promising Young Woman (2020) follows a woman who is traumatised by a tragedy her friend experienced in the past; she then decides to seek vengeance on those who wronged her friend. I adore this movie and everything it stands for, it resonates with me and I feel like this movie is VERY important."
tt9620292,"Promising Young Woman is a stunningly original revenge drama that shocks you, offers loads of dark humour and the same time makes you reassess every mildly sexist or politically incorrect statement/thought you have made/had in your life."
tt9620292,"I felt this was very much a ""Me Too"" movie about a woman's revenge. Yes, that is topical for the year of it's making and the clever screenplay makes it seem possible for a woman, Carey Mulligan in this case, to exact the revenge that she does but it's not real. There are too many slick twists and turns to make it realistic but had Carey won her Oscar this time it would certainly have been deserved. Sadly she didn't but maybe next time. Drop dead gorgeous with her flowing blonde hair, she's an acting masterclass here and I was sorry when it was all over. A funny/serious black comedy that will make you wonder what's going on to begin with until you see the ease with which her personality changes from charming to sinister."
tt9620292,"I'm not too much of a fan of rape-revenge themed movies, because they're just so unbelievably depressing and too triggering for my taste."
tt9620292,"""I'm a nice guy.""
""Are you?"""
tt9620292,"It's a comedy, but not really."
tt9620292,"I have 3 little ones. Two boys and a girl. On one hand, I'd never want my sons to be accused of or punished for something they DIDN'T do, on the other hand I'd never want anything to happen to my daughter & then especially no one believe her. I myself went through my own ""event"" at a Halloween party almost ten years ago when I was a young 20 year old girl. I think what hurts more than the actual night, and the person who did it, it's all the family and close friends who didn't believe me, ignored me, or even blamed me. After a while you just stop talking about it. You shut it away. & Then this brilliant movie comes into your life. This movie sends two clear messages: It doesn't matter what you were wearing, how much you had to drink, your past relationships, if you made the first move... If you weren't cognitive enough to make a consensual choice, or you said no, or you fought it, seriously it WAS NOT your fault. And the other clear message, she gave each guy in the movie a chance to do the right thing and they chose not to. They actively chose to make the wrong choice. So, they were completely at fault and deserved their day of reckoning. I only wish I had a friend even half the character Cassie is in this movie. My best friend since we were children said it was my fault because I was dressed too sexy (I was dressed in a 1920's flapper costume from Walmart & had a hoodie on top of it). We haven't spoken in years because of that. Today, her words still haunt me more than that night and make me sick to my stomach. You're loved ones should have your back more than anyone. So the message of true devotion in friendship and sisterhood here was especially lovely. This isn't something that happens exclusively to only a certain type of woman, this happens to all women. & Movies like this will be how we put an end to it for our future, our children & loved ones."
tt9620292,"The subject matter is still sadly something that still needs to be taken seriously in today's society. Needs to be shown especially to college & high school students. Carrie did such a great job, I've never seen her play anything similar to this."
tt9620292,"PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN (2020) ***1/2 Carey Mulligan, Bo Burnham, Jennifer Coolidge, Clancy Brown, Laverne Fox, Adam Brody, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Alison Brie, Connie Britton, Max Greenfield, Molly Shannon, Alfred Molina. Filmmaker Emerald Fennell scored a Best Original Screenplay Oscar for this dark, psychological drama with Mulligan (nominated for Best Actress, justifiably so) as the titular character, a former law school student, whose traumatic past encapsulates her future by planning vengeance upon those who perpetuated a crime against her and her late best friend. Dark, black humor and unsettling to the point of disturbing the film penetrates toxic masculinity with pin pricking intensity and deeply felt undertones of despair."
tt9620292,"I salute the effort to treat a topic too few movies are willing to tackle. But everything from the teasers to the promotion (imagery, posters, etc.) led me to believe the movie would push the concept a lot further than it did.. In the end I feel this would have made more of an impact if it had either gone a more serious/conservative and realistic route (some situations are quite implausible), OR the complete opposite, with someone being pushed over the edge and devolving into madness/violence a la Joker/John Wick. As it stands the movie is too middle of the road, not knowing what it wants to be, just like the main character and it left me unsatisfied."
tt9620292,"There's no doubt in my mind that this film is my favourite. To be completely honest, 2020 sucked in terms of filmmaking (obviously everything else as well) so that isn't saying much. But Promising Young Woman is a movie that utilises a great soundtrack and score, fantastic acting and great direction to create a fantastic film. To me this is a movie that both works as an entertaining revenge film (with a twist) and a fascinating exploration of its themes."
tt9620292,"""Promising Young Woman"" is a revenge thriller film written and directed by Emerald Fennell. Starring Carey Mulligan in the lead role, it rises above the typical revenge fantasy to become one of the most unique and intricately plotted films in quite a while."
tt9620292,"This was a pretty good movie but just didn't get there for me. I don't know if i'm more used to more extreme versions of this type of movie, but it seemed fairly tame. And for the most part, it was completely predictable from beginning to end. It was funny and charming but in the end i wasn't satisfied (1 viewing, 4/7/2021)"
tt9620292,"I remember seeing this trailer multiple times the last few times I went to the movie theater before the pandemic started, and I found the trailer pretty exciting. I thought, ""Really interesting cast for this type of movie. This looks like it has potential, but it could go both ways..."""
tt9620292,This movie is insanely good. I think the strongest reason for this is how much Emerald Fennell cared while making this movie. It is so detail oriented.
tt8503618,"Greetings again from the darkness. You know what it's like when people start talking about some great new restaurant that just opened (think back to pre-pandemic)? And then you start to hear your friends and co-workers raving about it ... best 'steamed broccoli' (ok, insert your favorite entrÃ©e) I've ever tasted! Having been burned many times with high expectations, you remain skeptical, but make the reservation. Well, that's been me with ""Hamilton."" For almost 5 years, the hype was just too much. Surely folks were caught up in the frenzy, and peer pressure was such that no one would admit it wasn't all that. So, now I'm here ... throwing myself at the mercy of the Theater Gods. Thanks to Disney Plus, I only needed to invest a little (ok, a lot) of time, rather than a few hundred dollars for a ticket. This is me humbly admitting I was wrong. The show is fantastic, and I only wish my first viewing had been a live performance."
tt8503618,"I am not even a fan of musicals, but this is excellent. The songs are great, as they are upbeat and modern. The production, acting, stage set up and the story are all great. I really enjoyed it."
tt8503618,"'Hamilton' was a major surprise for me when seeing and hearing it. Music is such a big part of my life, being now a semi-professional singer and raised into a musical family, and am a fan of musicals, especially the golden age ones. History was also one of my favourite and best subjects in most of my up and down school life, until it didn't work out in sixth form when my confidence went and my comprehension and drive worsened. So having a musical to combine the two immediately intrigued me, despite not being the biggest fan of the dominant styles here (was raised on classical music and opera personally)."
tt8503618,"I started watching this out of curiosity and to say I have seen it, being the cultural touchstone that it is. At first, I was a little detached, not liking the songs too much, and thinking I would probably just skip through to end in a minute. I couldn't stop watching and it really sucked me in. I have to say, I'm not sure I would have enjoyed it at all, live in the theater. I benefited greatly from the captions and the ability to put it on pause to consult Wikipedia from time to time. The lyrics were so clever and really told the story. I ended up very moved and almost cheering at the end. Of course, now that I am familiar with the story, I would love to see it live and would enjoy it immensely. But I would strongly recommend this for a first time viewing. I will definitely re-watch. And probably again and again."
tt8503618,"I'm a mexican boy who has never got the chance to go to Broadway, all I've seen are bootlegs, and they're fine but not like this. This is a beautiful shot of the great spectacle Hamilton is, the flawless music of Lin Manuel Miranda, the production, the photography, costumes. And the acting, Leslie Odom Jr., RenneÃ¨, Miranda and Daveed Diggs shine on their roles, I don't know is this can be nominated for any award, but damn it deserves it"
tt8503618,"There was so much hype surrounding Hamilton that I thought there was no way it could live up to expectations-and yet it does. The songs in this musical production are complex and emotional, and the story explains the history of our founding fathers in an engaging way. Yes, it would probably be better to see it on stage and no, it's not perfect, but I'm glad I was finally able to see Hamilton performed instead of just listening to the soundtrack."
tt8503618,How incredible to be able to see this show on TV instead of going to New York and spending $800.
tt8503618,One critic recently wrote a list of three great musicals that must be seen on stage. Hamilton was one of them.
tt8503618,"Musical based on the life of Alexander Hamilton, one of the founding fathers."
tt8503618,"Having seen the play and loving it, I was set for a disappointment. No chance. With the one limitation of being confined to a screen, the portraya was extremely well done. With a minimum of close-ups, the filming of the staging worked well. The sound was very good, few words lost. Since this was the original cast, we got to see the thing at its best. I will leave it to others to get into the plot details. I was intrigued from beginning to end."
tt8503618,"Like the rest of the world, I watched ""Hamilton"" on Disney Plus this weekend. Though I have seen a number of stage musicals, I haven't seen ""Hamilton"" yet, so this was my first opportunity to see the highly regarded show and I have to say that it didn't disappoint."
tt8503618,"I was fortunate enough to see Hamilton 3 times in Chicago, including once from the second row thanks to a friend winning the lottery. How did this compare? WAY better than I expected, honestly. I noticed new moments. I saw the original cast in a new light. I experienced the story like I was onstage. There's nothing quite like being in the theater, but this may be the closest a film crew ever got to capturing theater magic. (I wish the RENT movie had been a recording of a 1996 production...) Hamilton represents a unique moment in American theatre, and I'm grateful someone captured it."
tt8503618,"Yesterday, a bazillion folks tuned in to Disney+ to see the debut of ""Hamilton""...a recording of the Broadway show back in 2016. Because it's not a traditional movie-style musical, it's pretty difficult to compare it to a typical film in the genre. It's also a film whose enjoyment definitely depends on your age. I am in my mid-50s....hardly the age to like hip-hop style music in a musical. But, despite this, I did respect what the show was trying to accomplish--to bring America history to the masses AND to make it more accessible to minorities as most of the parts were played by Black and Hispanic actors and actresses. So, while having the likes of George Washington and Aaron Burr played by black actors isn't historically accurate, it does help make history more inclusive....as did the very modern music. And, as an ex-history teacher, I am thrilled about these things even if I wasn't all that fond of the singing. Well worth seeing....and a nice chance to publicize a few nearly forgotten great Americans."
tt8503618,"""Hamilton"" is a Biography - Drama musical in which we watch the life story of one of the founding fathers and the first Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton. We learn more about him, his work and his life."
tt8503618,I thought after all I've heard and read about this musical phenomenon that July 4th would be an appropriate evening to judge for myself and I'm so pleased to say all the hype about Hamilton is true it is truly a fabulous stage show.
tt8503618,"This was an exciting thing for me. I, like most people, had heard of Hamilton. It was/is a HUGE phenomenon on Broadway and launched the careers of some incredible people. Miranda is always the fun, quirky, goofy musical wizard that pops up in shows now and then. Leslie Odom Jr. has always had this impishly wicked energy to him. Oh, and lets not forget Daveed Diggs, the up and comer who, after Blindspotting and a couple other things, I would watch in just about anything. Unfortunately, I live light years away from any decent stage so the odds of me seeing this in real life seemed like something that may just never happen. Enter the magical world of Disney and I am given the opportunity to finally experience the phenomenon myself, albeit not in the original form. Of course, with all the build up and all the hype, I was worried it couldn't possibly measure up."
tt8503618,"I've loved ""Hamilton"" since the music first became available on iTunes. I must have listened to almost every song a thousand times. Getting to watch the impeccable, exquisite awesome original cast for $6??? Wow! To the people who gave it low ratings because they only made it through part of the first act and didn't like it, I suggest: Stay for Act 2. (Wait for it.) The first act is all youthful, explosive, revolutionary energy. The second act has a lot more variety to the songs - and some of them may make you cry. Plus, if you don't see Act 2, you totally miss Daveed Diggs' hilarious, winning performance as Jefferson. (I love him. Daveed Diggs, that is.) And I look at the historical inaccuracies this way: Yes, the F Fathers had terrible s--t about them ), but the musical is perhaps largely about ideals - and also maybe how those get turned into back-room deals (The Room Where It Happens). I don't mistake the characters as written as exacting portrayals of the actual men, who were by and large awful men - but I wish the cast WERE the F Fathers. :)
So I let the musical be what it is, and what it is musically, lyrically, and acting-wise, is breathtaking. And it's just one (wonderful) show. I enjoy it by not asking it to be more than that. And I can see it as many times as I want for just $6!!!!"
tt8503618,Although many musical adaptations have flopped this may have proved that best way to do it is simply film the play. What you get is one of the best musicals available to watch whenever you like at an affordable price. Great work by everyone involved especially Lin Manuel Miranda.
tt8503618,"Review:
'Hamilton' is a Broadway musical filmed for TV with music and lyrics by Lin-Manuel Miranda. It tells the story of American Founding Father Alexander Hamilton. The show's music draws heavily from hip hop, as well as R&B, pop, soul, and traditional-style show tunes.
I've heard about the Broadway musical for years now but being located in a small town there was no way I would be able to see the show. When I heard it was coming to Disney+ I was both excited and nervous due to the fact I wasn't sure if it would be a victim of overhype. I'm am happy to be able to say this is a true masterpiece of a show that will make you want to revisit it again and again,
The show casts non-white actors as the Founding Fathers and other historical figures and it is truly brilliant. It showcases the actor's talents and makes a stand against racial stereotypes and Xenophobia. It is both amazing and heartbreaking watching these actors on the big stage. They are brilliant in the way the move and remember their lines during this three-hour long event. Stage shows and their actors are an underappreciated form of art and storytelling. Everybody in this show did a perfect job, but there was one actor who seemed to be having a blast in his role and played two completely different character perfectly, Daveed Diggs.
Aside from having an incredible story of the 'lost' Founding Father, Alexander Hamilton, the show has a brilliant soundtrack that has seamless transitions between scenes. It keeps your eyes glued to the screen and you don't want the show the end. With having super limited space and production design, they were able to showcase different parts of the world and the United States just by having different dress codes and props, and it is done with ease.
Overall, I am urging everybody to watch this amazing piece of art. If you are a fan of musicals you will love this, and if you aren't the biggest fan of musicals I truly believe that the music in this show alone will keep you engage and intrigued to what the story is telling.
5/5"
tt8503618,"If you're not a fan of musicals and can't bear listening to songs for more than 150 minutes without any dialogues, then this film isn't for you. Everything is expressed through songs and you won't listen them talking without being in rhythm. It has 50+ songs (yes, you read that right) in its 2 hour 40 mins runtime. Like other musicals, it does not have songs of a definite genre, but it comprises jazz, rap, hip-hop, acapella, soft songs and many more. Since musicals have a limited audience, it won't gain much popularity. It's a pity that films like Extraction and 365 Days get so much hype whereas a great work like this goes unnoticed."
tt8503618,"I really do enjoy the Hamilton soundtrack and was so excited to actually view the performance! However, in a sense, I do think I listened to the soundtrack too much to the point where I 'know' what happens too well. For watching the musical, I recommend not over-saturating oneself with other Hamilton media."
tt8503618,This 2016 movie of the stage show is excellent for a lot of reasons. The cast has a lot to do with that. Every cast member makes their role real and memorable. They do it smoothly. They earn the massive applause they receive for each number. It's easy to see why.
tt8503618,"I know a little bit about America's founding fathers. Not a lot, it's not really taught in the UK. That's not important though. Knowing any history to enjoy this I mean, not America's independence. Musicals aren't my thing either and certainly not musical theatre, which this is with several exclamation points. What we have here is the theatre production, filmed, fairly simply. A few camera angles covering the stage, mostly wide to show off a lovely set, occasional close up to, well to provide some variation in the edit, nothing more. This is the thing, it's a show designed to be enjoyed in the room. There's no set camera positions. The camera is normally your eye from your seat. That's not possible right now though, which is why this exists. So it's not a film. It works though and it's undeniably a spectacle. If you don't like singing and dancing, you might think you're buggered. Honestly though, this is pretty top quality singing and dancing, you're in safe hands. It's fast and fun, the energy dialled all the way up. The mix of humour, hip hop and show tunes will make even the most hardened cynic smile. Alright it's gimmicky, actors spitting bars wearing frock-coats, declaring war, but I guess the rules are different in theatre and it's very effective. In film it's often said that if the actors look like they're having too much fun, the audience aren't. I don't think that applies here either, everybody looks to be having the time of their lives and the live audience, that we hear but don't see, seem to be too. It's pretty lengthy, but there's a lot in there, not least a pretty eventful life story. Alexander Hamilton. Rags to revolutionary. A social climbing agitator, with a love of writing and setting up financial institutions. Weddings, duals, adultery, bribery, a bloody big war and a lot of political manoeuvring. The historical content is top line stuff, covering the basics. They're touch points really, never allowing the story to get too dry, but it manages this without dumbing it down too much and the razor sharp humour helps, ""Immigrants we get the job done"". The cast are wonderful. Daveed Diggs as both Lafayette and Jefferson is the standout for me. There are quieter moments, but there's sequences where it's one bombastic banger after another. Canon fire and scratching, the score gets pretty raucous. I went it with a little trepidation, but Lin-Manuel Miranda has indeed created something marvellous. It. Is. Spine-tinglingly brilliant. I might have to stop saying I don't like musicals."
tt8503618,"I'll just cut to the chase, the filmed version of the mega-hit stage musical HAMILTON (now streaming on Disney+) is terrific. If you are one of the few that have not seen this, check it out - you'll be glad you did."
tt8503618,I have been waiting a long long time to see this! Definitely not a let down!
tt8332922,"Cannot believe the number of people who are claiming this movie is the same as the first. Just ridiculous! I have to wonder whether they saw the same A Quiet Place Part 2 that I saw. It obviously follows similar themes but builds on the story and further develops the characters. You have to give it up to writer/producer/director and actor John Krasinski. He has delivered a sequel which really enhances the story he introduced in Part 1 but this time, is played out on a much broader canvas."
tt8332922,"Although AQPII is not bad, it does look like an attempt to cash in. There's a few problems with it and most of them are in the storyline. Here is an overall difference with the first film:"
tt8332922,"After a brief flashback to Day 1, this film picks up from where Part 1 left off, with newly widowed Evelyn tiptoeing away from her burning house with her kids, deaf Regan, Marcus, and strangely silent baby The Baby. They fall in with Emmett, and Regan wants to take her squealing hearing aid to an island redio transmitter in order to mess up the critters' hearing."
tt8332922,"If nothing else, I'm primarily impressed with how these films seem like a cinematic franchise built out of the raptors in the kitchen sequence from Jurassic Park. This is the very rare sequel that at the very least is equal to what came before and it reminded me how much I missed going to the movies."
tt8332922,"Nothing makes logical sense in this sequel, just like the first one."
tt8332922,"When the movie ended I was left with the distinct feeling that I must have missed something, because Quite Place Part II seemed to me the exact same film as Part I, albeit with some new characters added to the cast."
tt8332922,"I liked how the story begins with how the whole invasion began. They should have spent more time on this. As a matter of fact, this should have been a worldwide view of how humanity failed against the invasion. Instead, you get a story that at times makes you wonder if you missed something (on the pier especially). Also, the son appears to have gotten stupid since the first movie. The ending is rather contrived. With all the periods of silence in the movie and the style of showing two or three parts of the story all intermingled at once, you get very aware of the director ""doing something"". It weakens the film. The ending is so contrived that you think.....""say whattttt"". The characters' decisions in this movie make for many plot holes where their actions in the original are not something you question. So is the sequel how they get the daughter's discovery out there, If you can believe no one else figured this out. For that matter, I wondered how this type of creature can create and fly a spaceship. Do they multiply here? Were they kicked off a planet like Alien Nation? These creatures don't seem to have intelligence, organization or government. It's like the dinosaurs figured out how to build a spaceship and fly through space. The movie grossed about $350 million so there will be an unnecessary sequel. Watch a movie called ""Earth vs. The Flying Saucers"" from the mid-1950s and you will see the same ""discovery"" on how to kill the monsters."
tt8332922,"I liked this as much as the first one. It was very suspenseful at parts and very slow other parts. My main gripe of these movies is how the characters act in certain situations. You scratch your head thinking no way they would do that. Anyway, a quick action thriller and worth the watch if you are a fan of the first one."
tt8332922,"I always say the opening scene/sequence of a film is crucial, and even more so in a horror movie. When the title card 'Day 1' pops up at the beginning of 'A Quiet Place Part 2' you know you are in for a treat. And it is a truly great sequence. I'm not normally a huge proponent of jump-scares, however the first one in this movie absolutely got me, and I'm rarely gotten. This sequence sets the tone for the film masterfully and then everything else flows from there."
tt8332922,"The first one was definitely better but this was so good. Cillian Murphy was a perfect edition to the cast. I didn't think it'd work without John Krasinski but I was definitely wrong. I very glad there's been a third one announced because I'd have hated the ending to this other wise. I think as far as horror films go these are the best of the best. There's none like it, and any that are like it just aren't nearly as good."
tt8332922,"A good sequel, which is a rarity!"
tt8332922,"Replace Krasinski with Cillian Murphy. This movie is basically more of the same thing, maybe a bit less surprising, or fresh; but you could watch these back to back and it would feel like an extension of the same movie. I found myself rooting for Murphy's character after I got acquainted with him."
tt8332922,.......and if you enjoyed the first one then you'll certainly enjoy this one too.
tt8332922,"If plot, suspense, thrills and drama would be translated into noise, this film indeed is an awfully quiet place."
tt8332922,"3/4 of the people think this is a good movie and I do as well. Better than the first movie, and adds to the knowledge of what is going on. The writing thing s better than the first movie, and adds to the lore. Minimizes the stupid CGI and expands on the storytelling for us. Recommend."
tt8332922,"The good: The film in of itself, is well made - everything from cinematography to lighting, sound, action, pacing etc. Big props for that. And of course the acting from the leads (including the younger actors) is excellent. I also like the way the 'passing of the torch' is shot - clearly defined parallels are drawn that make it easy to see the directors vision."
tt8332922,"The premise is still the same, blind monsters that somehow defeated the human race.. although you can kill them with a shotgun or hitting them with a metal bar.."
tt8332922,"The second installment of ""A quiet place II"" was one of the most anticipated and delayed films due to the pandemic. A sequel that is at the same level as its predecessor, it arranges the story linearly and keeps the viewer in constant tension during its short 90 minutes."
tt8332922,Nothing new was learned. Nothing new happened. The ending was almost identical. What an absolute waste of time.
tt8332922,"I liked the first part and was not sure what will they do in sequel. Well, they did decent work on it. The acting, direction, story, pacing, everything was good. Overall, it is a good watch which you will enjoy."
tt8332922,"A thoroughly disappointing continuation of the original story. It's lost all the charm of the original and lost sight of what made it special. It's not a quiet place anymore at all; the monsters are incompetent and less frightening, and pose none of the tension or suspense of the original. The characters are one dimensional and lacklustre, and the plot is essentially one big McGuffin hunt which is really unfortunate. I think the premise this world offers is still a very intriguing one and could be taken in lots of interesting directions, but this movie doesn't offer that. Hopefully any future sequels can do better if they are made. There's some good aspects (such as the backstory to the monsters; I loved that) but overall I think the plot's weak and the spark is gone."
tt8332922,Let me count the ways.
tt8332922,"This was excellent, best horror flick in years!!"
tt8332922,"Firstly, I appreciate that the producers respected the name of the movie and kept it as quite as possible, because I thought the movie wouldn't be quiet anymore after watching the trailer."
tt8332922,"The original film was a brilliant scary movie, one of the best I've seen in the last few years, and I was most excited when the sequel was eventually released in cinemas. Basically, it opens with a flashback, to the beginning of the alien invasion. The Abbott family are attending a baseball game, with Marcus (Noah Jupe) playing. Mid-game, the spectators are bewildered to see a flaming object in the sky hurtling towards Earth. As people leave the park and try to drive away, the town is attacked by alien creatures with armoured skin, high speed, and extraordinary strength. Father and husband Lee (John Krasinski, also writing and directing) slowly realises that the creatures are blind but have hypersensitive hearing to hunt their victims. In present day, most of the population have been wiped out by the aliens, Lee was killed sacrificing himself to save his children. His remaining family are his wife Evelyn (Emily Blunt), now adolescent Marcus, deaf teenage daughter Regan (Millicent Simmonds), and a new-born baby son. Regan, who discovered that high-frequency audio feedback is the weakness of the creatures, has found that transmitting the noise from her cochlear implant hearing aid through a microphone and speaker makes the creatures vulnerable, allowing Evelyn to shoot them dead. With their isolated home on the fame destroyed, and finding this method to kill the monsters, the family leave to find refuge and search for other survivors. They bring Regan's kit to fend off the creatures. They enter a fenced-off area, and trigger a booby-trap, and when they are forced to run, Marcus steps into a bear trap. His subsequent screams attract a creature, but Regan uses the kit to weaken it and Evelyn kills it. They free Marcus and flee into an abandoned steel foundry as another creature approaches. Inside, they stumble upon Emmett (Cillian Murphy), a former friend of Lee's, who has become a recluse. He takes them inside to hide from the creature, in a sound-proof area, and reluctantly allows them to stay in the bunker, seeing the baby. To protect the baby, and avoid his cries attracting the attention of the creatures, he is being kept inside a box, containing a breathing mask connected to an oxygen tank. Whilst hiding in the foundry, Marcus and Regan discover a radio station signal that continuously plays the song, ""Beyond the Sea"" by Bobby Darin. Regan determines it is a clue meant to lead survivors to the salvation of a group of nearby islands. She theorises that if she can reach the radio tower, the hearing aid's high-frequency noise can be transmitted for survivors to weaponize against the creatures. After telling Marcus her plan, she secretly ventures out alone to find the broadcast station. Discovering Regan is gone, Evelyn implores Emmett to bring her back. Emmett finds Regan exploring an abandoned train, containing only the corpses of victims to the monsters. After averting a creature attracted to sound made on the locomotive, Emmett wants them to return to the foundry. Emmett is initially sceptical about the plan to find the radio station, theorising that there may be no survivors at all, but he is convinced by Regan that they have a sense of duty to help others if they can. Meanwhile, Evelyn leaves Marcus and the baby at the foundry to gather needed medical supplies and equipment, including canisters of oxygen. During her absence, Marcus explores the foundry and discovers the corpse of Emmett's wife. He is startled and knocks something, creating sound that alerts a nearby creature. Marcus narrowly gets into the bunker, but accidentally locks himself and the baby inside, with breathable air and the oxygen remaining in a tank running out. At a marina, Emmett and Regan search for a boat. They are ambushed by feral people who begin to search Regan for supplies. Emmett shouts out to attract two creatures that slaughter the deranged inhabitants. Boarding a vessel, Emmett sees one creature drown and realises the aliens cannot swim. Regan secures a small boat and the two find the island where a small colony of survivors have settled, and they are living a relatively normal existence, with no need for silence. The colony leader (Djimon Hounsou) reveals that when the government discovered the creatures were unable to swim, the National Guard moved as many people as possible to the islands. Meanwhile, Marcus and the baby are still trapped in the air-tight bunker and are close to suffocating. Evelyn returns and distracts the creatures, using one of the two canisters she collected to ignite the monster, saving her children. The three continue hiding inside the bunker as the creature prowls the foundry. A creature that boarded a yacht at the marina has drifted to the island and immediately begins attacking the colonists. The colony leader, Emmett, and Regan jump into a car and lead the creature to the radio station. The creature kills the leader while Emmett and Regan make it inside. While Regan finds the source of the signal, a creature comes in to attack. The creature is about to kill Emmett, when Regan transmits the high frequency through the room's speakers, incapacitating the creature. She impales the alien's exposed head with a metal rod, killing it and saving Emmett. At the same time, the creature at the foundry has discovered the bunker. It attacks Evelyn, but before it can kill her, Regan's transmission plays through Marcus's portable radio, incapacitating the creature. Marcus shoots it dead with Evelyn's revolver. Regan leaves her hearing aid connected to the radio station's microphone, allowing anyone receiving the frequency to fight the creatures. Also starring Scoot McNairy as Marina Man, Dean Woodward as Beau Abbott, Okieriete Onaodowan as Police Officer, Zachary Golinger as Emmett's son, and Lauren Ashley Cristiano as Emmett's wife. The clever premise using the sense of sound is just about as tense as before, I was a little annoyed there was whispering in certain scenes, but the atmosphere remains eerie and immersive. The post-apocalyptic world is expanded, the survival element continues to be good, the monsters are still the stuff of nightmares, and the score by Marco Beltrami is terrific, overall, a satisfactory horror. Very good!"
tt8332922,"In a slasher flick, you expect the silly, ""Never split up..."" to quickly split up; or the ""Don't go in there..."" to immediately going in there. Yet, to do the same in a film that supposedly carries a bit more thought it just seems lazy."
tt8332922,"I remember the first one and how I was not entirely able to suspend my disbelief - and in some respect this still rings true here. The high pitch/tone concept is still in effect - and while we go back to day 1 for this - not just to see a (beloved) character which did not survive the first movie (yes it does make sense to watch the first one before seeing this then), but so we get a glimpse of a new very important character for the sequel."
tt8332922,"The Abbott family continue trying to live from day to day, however it's not just the monsters that poses a threat."
tt8332922,"Wait, didn't we just sit through this exact story once back in the 2018 release of ""A Quiet Place"", the first part?"
tt8332922,The movie starts with the arrival of the monsters. Then it proceeds to immediately after the first movie and the death of Lee Abbott (John Krasinski). Evelyn Abbott (Emily Blunt) and her three children seek a new refuge. They stumble upon old friend Emmett (Cillian Murphy) but he doesn't believe that he has enough supplies for everyone. He wants them out.
tt8332922,"I don't know if it was the excitement of being back in the theater after 15 months or this movie was that good, but I was enraptured. I enjoyed the sequel even more than the first. Again, it may have been the sheer giddiness of being back in the theater, but so what."
tt8332922,"Started good, a boring middle, the ending was showing signs of a good strong story then it ends abruptly like tune in next week for more. Nevermind wait for part 3 it is unacceptable for a film to end abruptly with no explanation as to what happens next."
tt8332922,"Best cinema experience I've had in a while. A near full house with a near silent crowd (some loud eaters heh). Some may not of enjoyed the lack of plot (as in not much happens) and the ending, but I just see this film as a continuation of the story (as it's obvious there will be a third). You have to remember that it's right after the ending of the first one so the setting and time is the exact same, I think some people didn't get that. Millicent Simmonds shines in this film and Cillian Murphy alongside her only makes it better. Emily Blunt is still great but steps down this time and let's Millicent take the spotlight and she uses it perfectly. I didn't find the sequel as scary as the first film, but the scenes that had some jump scares in them were executed very well. Replacing the lack of scares in this film are big action pieces, which are great on the big screen, but I would of preferred more silent scenes where sound is used as a jump scare element rather than big explosions and loud sounds, but the action was still intense. Again, the sound design is perfect, especially when we're through Regans perspective and sound is cut out completely. Favourite scene was definitely the opening, big action scenes and a good origin to how the world is how it is. The only thing that bugged me was the theme of family has died down. It's now become 'every man for himself' almost, but we get a few moments that revolve around the theme of family, but you can see Regan and Marcus trying to be like their father during the film and trying to lead the family to safety. Highly recommend seeing this film, even if horror is not your taste you can appreciate the sound and production design."
tt8332922,This had a lot of potential but some parts were just lazily written. The son becomes an idiot. The daughter too becomes an idiot and abruptly leaves the family and safety because she thinks she can find a source of the radio music all by herself? That was one of the most poorly written parts. The daughters disgust for Emmet (Cillian Murphy) seemed way out of place and poorly written. The people at the dock had no explanation for their behavior - and they were on boats but they never figured out these creatures can't swim? I loved the beginning when they flash back the moment before and during the initial confrontation with the aliens. They need more of that. There is a part 3 in the works and I'd rather it be prequel showing how humans fought the aliens initially before going into hiding.
tt8332922,"IN A NUTSHELL:
Wow. This is the very first movie I've seen in an actual theater for over a year! A Quiet Place II was one of the first movies to delay its theater release when the pandemic first started. This morning, I was invited to a press screening in a local theater with just 9 other film critics. The movie picks up right where A Quiet Place left off. Following the horrific events at home, the Abbott family now faces the terrors of the outside world. Forced to venture into the unknown, they realize the creatures that hunt by sound are not the only threats lurking beyond the sand path..."
tt8332922,"Isn't it funny that when you see a pretty good film a part of you wants to see what happens next. Well, inevitably what happens next is actually not much, and that is certainly the case with this film. Okay, this film does have some interesting aspects to it, but the thing is that while the first film was pretty tense, this one sort of drops the ball somewhat. Mind you, seeing the cinema packed again does suggest that maybe things are getting back to normal, meaning that cinema worthy films are starting to appear on the big screen again, and people are happier to go back and check them out."
tt8332922,After a long wait the sequel to the great film A Quiet Place has made its way to the cinema here in the UK and I watched it last night and here is my review for it. The premise of the film picks up straight from the end of the last film and sees the Abbot family attempt to survive in this world.
tt8332922,"5/10 - as one might expect, those who consider themselves fans of the first one will find plenty to love here (and even maybe a more focused plot) while those, like me, who didn't get the hype will continue to see the series as only okay."
tt8332922,"I clearly enjoyed the second part .it have the Same DNA than the first one and still have some tense moments .I enjoyed also the flashback at the beginning that introduce the Emmet character. Like the first one , the movie have a very contemplative side and look nice to see . Its always about survival and i enjoyed the rythm all along :sometimes its slow but become more faster after a while. I really recommend the second part to all the people who liked the first movie . It end pretty fast and im wondering if a quiet place part 3 is plan . But this one was clearly good and if you are looking for a horror movie who have a different style to make the scare ( trough sound) ,go for it ."
tt8332922,"Quiet Place Part 2 is far better directed than it is written; you could probably say the same for the first, but the gap between them was not nearly as wide as it is here. Can the aliens drive boats now? Why was the music so quiet? Why did the message have to be coded in a song? What happened to those crazy people at the docks? It's not terrible, but I'm shocked people think it's better than the near-masterpiece that is the first film. If nothing else, it's lesser because it's mostly just more of the same."
tt8332922,"I had watched the first movie almost 4 years ago so it was nice that the opening of this sequel had scenes recapping what happened. We see families at a boys' baseball game when something happens in the sky and soon the sightless alien creatures are wreaking havoc and people are running for cover. As we know from the first movie Lee didn't survive so we join mom, Evelyn, and the kids. Plus a brand new baby. To witness how they are learning to survive."
tt8332922,This moving pictures has a full of WONDERFUL LOGICAL SENSE so I couldn't be bothered to even depicted a coherent sentences to faithfully illustrate this movie's styles and story. This will answer many intriguing questions with unquestionably firm logical answers.
tt8332922,A Quiet Place Part II is a movie that starts with it's signature move to put the audience right in the middle of suspense and thrill. Director John Krasinski's style of storytelling will make you stuck in your seat and make you crave for more. Acting performances in the movie don't go down even for a bit. Everyone delivered a stunning performance and shined whenever they got time on the screen. Screenplay of the movie is as good as it can be but somewhere in the middle it gets a little down and things become kinda predictable at a certain point. The pacing of the movie starts and ends on a good note with just a few bumps in the middle. The editing and sound design is always a big highlight for this movie series and it shined in this one also. Overall this movie is a must watch especially in the theatres and everyone will enjoy the balance a mix of suspense of thrill with a good enough story.
tt8332922,"It has its share of tense moments and the aliens are pretty cool, but there are too many contrivances used to set up drama, and that kept me from fully enjoying it. The clearly effective device that the aliens are vulnerable to strangely not being immediately embraced/replicated/used, the tendency of characters to run instead of standing still when an alien is around, the extraordinarily placid baby that doesn't cry, the recurring theme of family members wandering off on their own without talking to the others, etc.... it's all too calculated and doesn't stand a lot of scrutiny. I liked the strength in the deaf girl (Millicent Simmonds) and wish the film had revolved more around her, instead of trying so hard to set up the scenes with her mother (Emily Blunt) and brother (Noah Jupe). It's not an awful film and to its credit it gets in and out in 97 minutes, but it's just pretty average fare."
tt8332922,"So many things lack sense, I'm not commenting on that. Cute but silly monsters that can't stand a screechy noise, don't see very well, can cut through metal easier than butter and just run to kill like terminator 2. I liked the beyond the sea song though. Such a good song. Well, it's some sort of slasher/monster/horror movie."
tt8332922,"Really loved the first 'A Quiet Place' while acknowledging that it is not for everybody. Some felt it was too unrealistic, with frustrating character behaviours and a senseless ending. Many others found it incredibly atmospheric, clever, genuinely unnerving and extremely well acted. Count me in as someone in the latter category. Count me in also though as somebody who was not as enthused at the thought of a sequel when the first 'A Quiet Place' didn't strike me as one that desperately needed it."
tt8332922,Have you ever been watching a movie and wished every body moved at quarter speed?
tt8332922,"Though horror movies are ones I tend to avoid, I made it through both A Quiet Place movies. Much more belonging to the thriller genre than horror, they rely on jump-scares and suspense of ""will there or will there not be a scary scene coming up"". The creepy aliens, who hear noises and then kill whoever is responsible, are a bit gross to look at, but this isn't the type of movie that will make you hide behind your pillow."
tt8332922,"Following on from the first film, the Abbott family are on the move again, trying to avoid the sound-seeking killer creatures. They seek refuge with an old acquaintance and while he is accommodating they don't see eye-to-eye on all things. Then Regan sets off to find a radio station that may be their salvation, putting herself at great risk."
tt8332922,"It is a great pleasure to watch Regan and Marcus grow up to replace their dad's place. Adults settle and assess the situation realistically and safely while young ones hope and daringly challenge problems. The level of concentration of viewers diminished a little compared to the first one because the main story is divided into two, but because of that, 'A Quiet Place Part II' becomes more dynamic and adventurous. Building suspense with sound did it again. It totally works!"
tt7395114,"Wow. I thought I was in for something else. I didn't think this movie would be in such a high level on artistic grounds. Great story and the director shot with a correct pace which would not bore us. The casting was excellent and all did great. The music is other impressive thing in this movie. I'm happy that Netflix is delivering some content driven good movies nowadays. Overall, I recommend this movie because it's crazy and worth your time."
tt7395114,"This is a film in which the connections among multiple characters isn't fully revealed until late in the movie. There are also a number of people who you key in on as principal players who suddenly drop out of the picture, though for obvious reasons as it turns out. As such, you may have to concentrate just a bit more on what's going on than in your average story with a linear chronology, as a handful of flashbacks are utilized to provide background detail that becomes important later on. For some viewers the slow burn nature of the picture may prove daunting, and it's dark themes may not resonate with the timid, but for those who stick with it, you'll be treated to a compelling drama of a young man who's forced to straddle the line between good and evil in an often unsuccessful attempt to protect the ones he loves. Despicable characters abound in the picture, none more so than the wicked preacher Preston Teagardin (Robert Pattinson), although his forerunner Roy Laferty (Harry Melling) I would consider a close second. By the time this film is over, you'll come to agree with the ill fated Sheriff Lee Bodecker (Sebastian Stan), who states to a young Arvin Russell in a critical flashback scene - ""Some people were born just so they could be buried..."". Turns out, there's a lot of that going on."
tt7395114,"A powerful movie! Great storyline, great acting!"
tt7395114,"The Devil All the Time is a slow burn, thriller and melodrama with outstanding acting, exceptional editing, and precise cinematography. I love the focus on the theme of evil disguised as good. The film focuses on people who are thinking they are doing good under the guise of religion, God, and divine right instead of the harsh reality that they are terrible people committing terrible atrocities. Unfortunately, this is true to life. Obviously, this isn't saying all religious people are evil. It's more so that people are using religion as an excuse to commit crimes. The performances are all really good, and provide a look into the minds of sick, vile humans. The film is deeply disturbing because of how true to life it is and how it focuses on real life themes. It's extremely well crafted, and I love how it's presented, using voice over narration to dictate the flow of the film. The plot is a little convoluted, and the story could've been more thought out. Get ready for a slow descent into disturbing madness. This is one for the ages."
tt7395114,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)"
tt7395114,"From the start, you realize it will be a long movie, with already being more than two hours long. It's a slow-burn movie, with a great story, great acting from actors that we love for their roles in other movies. Here we see they can be more, they took the risk and made something great and worth watching. Netflix as usual gives as every month a new movie to talk about, but this one we will remember for a while."
tt7395114,"Mean, cruel, and unflinching, Devil All the Time is indeed a highly depressing movie. It's also one I couldn't look away from. It's full of misery, loss, and irredeemable characters placed against a southern gothic background. Tom Holland's portrayal of a good man whose actions send him on a cascade of increasingly worsening situations is at the heart of this well-made flick. Good pick for an evening's entertainment if you're a Netflix subscriber."
tt7395114,"I will make this very quick. This movie is a breath of fresh air for Netflix originals. This acting is superb, everyone brings their A game. The story is dark, but trust me it's not as dark as people say. If you have ever seen ""The Road"", that is very dark. This is just kinda f'd up. The story is complex but easy to follow, and it just get's you invested. Also a very good script with some lines that I will remember for awhile. The cinematography is very good too. Honestly, nothing really bothered me or stood out as bad. A very good experience, and I would recommend."
tt7395114,"The story spans from WWII to Vietnam War dealing with deaths in religious rural America. Willard Russell (Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd) returns home from WWII in the Pacific after suffering from trauma. He marries waitress Charlotte (Haley Bennett) and together they have son Arvin. Arvin (Tom Holland) would become an orphan. He moves in with his grandparents who have adopted Lenora Laferty. They are raised as siblings. Lenora falls for new preacher Reverend Preston Teagardin (Robert Pattinson). Oh, there is also serial killer couple, Carl and Sandy."
tt7395114,In backwood towns of West Virginia and southern Ohio during the mid-60s several characters converge around a disillusioned orphan (Tom Holland) devoted to protecting those he loves.
tt7395114,"So there's this new film on Netflix where Spider-Man, Batman and the Winter Soldier make up only a few of the oddball characters in the bleak and unforgiving crime thriller, The Devil All the Time, from Antonio Campos. Now, I'm going to stop right there and tell you that is a ridiculous way to approach this film yet it seems some just aren't ready to relate the actors in this film to anything other than the superhero films they've either already graced or about to. The three respective actors are only a small part of an ensemble cast that may just be the most imipressive of the year."
tt7395114,"Every performance in the film is flawless in my opinion. the characters are all very well written and the story is too. if this movie does not get any Oscar nominations I will be pissed. easily one of the best movies of 2020, not that I have seen many."
tt7395114,"AntÃ³nio Campos should be really proud of this one. Usually I don't care for a narrator during this movie but when is Pollock telling the story everything gets better. Pollock gives an excellent narrative full of opinions and insults for each character. The story is well written, even with the cross between storylines witch is always difficult to do. The cast is superb! Everyone one is so memorable. My surprise was Herry Melling! He was great in every scene speacialy the one with the spiders"
tt7395114,"Well not all over, as the movie states right at the beginning, we do have a certain area that is being the center of it. Even if that area or rather the cities themselves do not exist. But that is of course for the purpose of the movie and to be as vague as possible as to people not being offended ... like if their town/village name was mentioned."
tt7395114,"This is a drama with a lot of killing. The film first focuses on Willard (Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd) in 1957, a WWII vet who has seen horrors. It then shifts to his son. We needed Willard to understand his son Arvin (Tom Holland). The film shifts between small towns in Ohio and West Virginia and has a subplot. It also contains third person narration that was done by someone doing a light version of Sam Elliot. Next time just get Sam Elliot and don't call any of the characters ""dude."""
tt7395114,"'The Devil All The Time (2020)' is an incredibly uneven experience. At times, it's atmospheric and compelling; at others, it's dull and undisciplined. Essentially, it follows a few different story strands featuring characters who eventually cross each other's paths in relatively intricate ways. It also jumps back and forth between a couple of time periods to provide backstories for some of its major players, focusing on their parents in order to give you a better understanding of what makes them tick. The picture deals with things such as faith, sin, delusion, fate and family, positing that violence always begets violence but sometimes can't be helped anyway. Occasionally, it's interesting and well-conceived, but it's just as often uninspired and clumsy. This is frustrating, to say the least. There's persistent narration (from the source novel's own author) that initially seems like a way to add flavour and condense the flick's lengthy set-up (seriously, it's about an hour long) but eventually evolves into a way for it to simply tell us what its characters are thinking. It isn't awful and can sometimes be rather atmospheric, but it feels somewhat intrusive and, frankly, unnecessary. Sometimes, it's almost like the movie is supplementing the narration rather than the other way around. Another issue is that the film feels as though it lacks a solid through-line. Even its individual stories seem like a series of isolated events until they suddenly start to come together towards its conclusion. It's in its final movement that the affair finds its most success, as its stories start to satisfyingly intertwine and a strong sense of foreboding creeps in. You're never quite sure how things are going to end up, which makes for a fairly tense finale. Overall, the film is a mixed bag. It's atmospheric, well-made and often enjoyable. It's also long, unfocused and relentlessly grim. It could have done with a bit of tightening up, to be honest. However, the further away you get from it, the more fondly you remember the experience. Perhaps that's primarily because it has such a solid third act. It leaves a stronger impression in retrospect than it does in the moment. In the end, it's a good movie that's dampened somewhat by its flaws. 6/10"
tt7395114,"When i first saw Tom Holland he was a great addition to spiderman. But my god he had much more to give and this film just shows it. We know bill skarsgard is an amazing acting anyway but also robert pattinson gives a brilliant performance.
Back to Tom Holland. He is incredible in this. I never thought he'd go beyond marvel and into 18+ films. He suits it so much more and that lad is TALENTED! His performance is impeccable.
This is one of the greatest films of the year."
tt7395114,"If you want to loose trust in humanity, watch it. It has plenty of bad persons that like to do things I've never ever thought about. Religion is a thing that can drive you crazy. I love the grain and unsettling feeling I get from this movie. But I'm happy that I've great people around me after watching this."
tt7395114,"IN A NUTSHELL:
Netflix presents a new film directed by Antonio Campos based on the gothic crime novel also called The Devil All the Time. What's cool is that the movie is narrated by Donald Ray Pollock, the author of the book! Knockemstiff is a town featured in the movie that you'd swear was a made-up name, but it""s a real place where Pollack grew up. The movie is produced by Jake Gyllenhaal, which makes sense because the characters sort of feel like characters Jake has played in some of his former movies. Speaking of the cast, that's why you want to watch this movie. It's like attending an acting class. That being said, it's a bleak and gruesome movie that features the ugliness of twisted people. This is NOT a family-friendly film, nor one you want to watch with your grandma."
tt7395114,"After a string of misses so far this year when it comes to original features, Netflix finally gets one right with the no doubt depressing but captivatingly put together adaptation of Donald Ray Pollock's atmospheric dramatic thriller The Devil All the Time."
tt7395114,"OK so let me start out by saying this movie is not for everyone. People who are religious will not like this movie, if you have faith in mankind this movie will make you take a hit on that as well."
tt7395114,"Tom Holland, the ultimate star and protagonist of the movie, appears only after the first 45 minutes. This 140-minute movie should have been a mini-series (someone may still make one, for all I know). As well, the brilliant support Robert Pattison appears only after Holland does. But then, the 45 minutes of ""prelude"" is comprised of no less than 3 separate stories, each good enough to become a separate movie. They are, of course, inter-connected in one way or another."
tt7395114,The Devil All the Time (2.5 out of 5 stars).
tt7395114,"We've all met people who don't konw how to tell a story; no matter how good the story is , they'll make it a boring mess ."
tt7395114,"It's great to see a film written, without both eyes on the bottom line. An excellent script, well paced by an ensemble cast who all deliver their A game. Like any great film, each viewer may take a different message. I leave it to you to decide what it is but any film that makes you think after the credits roll has done its job. It's sad to think, that perhaps the only other outfit to be given funding for such a project are the Cohen brothers. We need more films like this, we deserve more films like this."
tt7395114,This movie made me forgot it is a movie. I was watching a real life story. Told as real as life can be. I am a movie critic and I got nothing bad to say at all.
tt7395114,"I'll explain the plot of this without revealing any spoilers, as I definitely think its worth a watch. Some people might look at 2 hours and 15 minutes as too lengthy or drug out, but when it is a movie like this that is done right and uses every minute of it's run time effectively to create a very compelling story, its really not."
tt7395114,"Good movie, great cast. I really don't know how two English boys can do a great southern accent, both so good."
tt7395114,"Jaz and I caught this masterpiece on Netflix over the weekend. This is more of a thriller than horror but focuses on sexual predators and the creation of serial killers. It reminded me of The Paperboy, Mystic River, Killer Joe and The Changeling (2008) in a lot of ways. The storyline evolves around terrible circumstances that happen to a family in the south and how it impacts the children in those families. The cast is absolutely outstanding and includes Bill Skarsgard (IT), Robert Pattinson (Tenet), Tom Holland (Spider-man), Haley Bennet (The Equalizer), Jason Clarke (Pet Semetary) and Harry Melling (Harry Potter). The directing and cinematography is also fantastic and is delivered by Antonio Campos (The Punisher and The Sinner television series). This is an Academy Award caliber movie and one of the more entertaining films I have seen this year (this and Tenet are probably my two favorites). I'd give this a 9.5/10 and a strong recommendation."
tt7395114,"So on many sites it became an issue about is this horror or isn't it or is it a drama with a dark theme. Well, horror it isn't for me that's for sure. For me it's a dark drama worth seeing if you like weird stories and movies that ask your brain to work it all out."
tt7395114,"Dark, Atmospheric, disturbing
Southern country setting , 80s scores, 2 generation of people , good acting/awesome casting choice , runs on pure emotions,
A brilliant cinema ."
tt7395114,"The Devil All the Time is a well directed, acted and shot movie. But it wasn't the movie I expected it to be. I thought I would see a film along the lines of Lawless (2012), as the movies appeared to be similar. While this film is wonderfully made, it is, so........boring. I found myself drifting off around half-way through. The pacing drags, and at times it can be difficult to follow. The plot bounces around, and it isn't until about 30 minuets or so from the ending, the film begins to pick up pace.
The cast is great, every single actors brings their all to the table, with the stand out being Tom Holland, even though he is barely even in the film. Robert Pattinson,is also brilliant here, with a very convincing accent, but he is underused and doesn't appear until far into the movie.
This film will appeal to a certain viewer, but I found it to drag at places,and found the plot to be boring and uninteresting.
4/10"
tt7395114,"Man, that was tough. Campos' The Devil All the Time is a heavy and difficult film to watch. It's long, it's slow and it's filled with one horrible character after another. Yet for some reason, I couldn't turn my eyes away."
tt7395114,"The acting makes it a film worth watching. It is dark gnarly and twisted. The reason for the low score is because I did not enjoy watching the movie. It is misery upon misery and if that is your thing, you are going to love it. However it was not for me"
tt7395114,"The Devil All the Time is a gruesome, violent, backwoods-gothic noir directed by Antonio Camposand and adapted from the 2011 novel by Donald Ray Pollock. This movie isn't for everybody but it offers a talented cast coping in a brutal landscape that gives no salvation. Tom Holland, Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd, Robert Pattinson and Riley Keough gave a great performance. The explosive nature of characters' storylines coming together made it all worth it."
tt7395114,"My earlier review which got more than 100 likes got deleted without containing any abusive or spoiler stuff.
Anyways i am happy that i managed to mess around certain fella's minds. Good to kno that certain irate fellas r monitoring my reviews n i am able to waste their time n energy."
tt7395114,Just got done watching this film and i gotta say This film is a amazing Thriller and Tom Holland is amazing in this film it felt like he was out of his Spiderman element and played a dark sinister Character Robert Pattinson who played the pastor his role is not meant to be liked but he really did his role very well really loved this film all around if you are watching this to see your favorites in this movie you shouldn't because this film is very dark and there are very dark things that happen in this film but i just cant get over how well everyone performed in this film Mainly tom holland his character was amazing he played it so well but overall the film is amazing i really loved it so if your looking to watch please give it a watch because it's a Must Watch.
tt7395114,Get ready for a depressing movie with superb acting.
tt7395114,The devil all the time is an American psychological thriller. The film was very slow and boring at first but it does getter better if you can persevere for 2 hours of watching a movie. The acting from Tom Holland and Robert Patterson was outstanding and was very believable. I would say there was not much suspense but I started to enjoy it more as it got better. A bit of a weird film and it depends on what you like. The devil all the time has mixed reviews so watch it for yourself and see if you like it. Not the best film I have seen but I did enjoy it eventually
tt7395114,What a drag! I just wasted 2 hours and 18 minutes of my life...
tt7395114,... which is still overly short for most of the evil characters that spring up here. A vehicle for some accomplished actors to peddle their wares but ultimately an unoriginal and cobbled concoction that struggles to engage during its formative establishment and fails to know when it's time to call it a day.
tt7395114,This movie is narrated and I love that. The acting is great as well as the many different characters. This movie is very dark but I didn't mind. My review is too short so I wrote that too.
tt7395114,"This is a really dark look into the religious roots of evil. Some great performances, a really good soundtrack and nicely paced."
tt7395114,"The script was great with high-quality actors but you need to know that the plot is tough to digest and some scenes are very sensitive. Although, for such a climax, in the end, it's worth it."
tt7395114,"This film sucked me in due to its sensationalism of a world of mentally-damaged people involved in sadistic violence and pornographic sex. I gave it a 5 score, because it was very effective at doing this. It was like gawking at a tragic, bloody road accident without the ability or even the desire to assist. I feel disappointed for allowing my imagination to be captured by such degenerate material. Although this sort of material is commercially popular, it definitely isn't healthy. I couldn't feel empathy for those, who suffered, because rather than containing their suffering, their immediate reaction was to lash out with violence at those they believed was the cause of their suffering. There were only a few tangental characters, that acted in a way, that I would describe, as normal. Maybe that was the point, to mirror the new upside-down world-view, that deranged is ""normal""."
tt7395114,"Some movies add artistic flourish, saturated colours or unconventional cinematography to distract from the true inner workings or real setting in a film. That is decidedly not the direction they went with The Devil All the Time. This movie is grimy, sad and uncompromising. The environment reflects the tone of the movie. The way they chose to shoot it helps drop any pretensions of what kind of movie you're going to get. The costuming, the sets and the visual style feel period accurate and it helps you wrap your mind around why all these characters are all so dissatisfied and why they feel fated to their dismal ends. This is a terrible people doing terrible things kind of picture and its presented for better for worse in its muddy, blood soaked, back alley glory."
tt7395114,"This movie changed my personal views on Robert Pattinson, I have never seen him in a role like this, this only proves that his acting skills is a force to be reckoned with. The movie itself is kind of bizarre and all over the place, the story can be a bit confusing to some and a little boring too, It is a movie that you watch once and move on with your life, the only thing that makes it worth watching is the acting."
tt7395114,"I jumped straight to this Netflix's thriller The Devil All The Time when it debuted, and it didn't disappoint me one bit."
tt7395114,"If Antonio Campos had adapted The Devil All The Time into a sprawling epic fit for TV, or even a three and a half hour tour de force, the material would have been better suited for adaptation. Conversely, even if Campos had dropped some of the subplots that populate Knockemstiff's dark and tragic history, and focused in on the section that shows Arvin and Reverend Teagardin's plotline, this could have been a lightning quick story of humanity's connection faith, and just what qualifies as good and evil."
tt2222042,Had pretty low expectations but I enjoyed this. I'd happily watch a sequel
tt2222042,"This film came out of nowhere. I hadn't heard anything about it, but I took a chance on it and I loved it! Love and Monsters was a really fun entertaining film. I really enjoyed the combination of romantic comedy and sci-fi/horror. It was well written, the acting was on point, and the film direction was very good. I really enjoyed the world-building in this film. The atmosphere and monsters were done very well. The post-apocalyptic world in this film is much different than in others where it's dark and murky. This film was bright and colorful and really showed that after 95% of humanity was gone, the environment took over un-restricted. Planes buried in mountains covered in vines, buildings overgrown with plants and trees, etc....It just looked really really good. Also....bonus points for having the cutest dog I have ever seen in my entire life! I think everyone who watches this is going to fall in love with that adorable brown puppy...and how could they not??? Great movie! Very well executed and definitely leaves you wanting more. I hope this is the start of something new!"
tt2222042,Solid well made movie - very good casting to put Dylan Obrien in this role - he works it perfectly. The rest of the cast is good and the special effects are well done. Solid plot and good action fun film. Worth watching.
tt2222042,"""Monster Problems"" has action, fantasy, comedy, survival and even love. It is a film for the whole family, but it manages to be quite tense, especially in action scenes involving monsters."
tt2222042,"Of all the films that I've watched over quarantine, Love and Monsters is the one that deserved to play in a theater."
tt2222042,"This is one of the best recent adventure films. It avoids many clichÃ©s that inhabit the genre, with small twists which made watching it a pleasure."
tt2222042,"Everyone involved in the making of this movie should be proud. Yes the plot is simple and it's been done many times in this genre and several others, like for instance The road, or The book of Eli or 28 days later... But in this case more like Zombieland if it was rated PG-13.
Dylan O'Brien plays Joel, a character much akin to Jesse Eisenberg's ""Columbus"", a kind of neurotic and unwilling protagonist out of his depth, who is rescued by Michael Rooker (playing Woody Harrelson's ""Tallahassee"") the grizzled survivalist with the adorable Minnow (Arianna Greenblatt playing Abigail Breslin's ""Little Rock"") in tow, whilst on a quest to find his love interest Aimee (the lovely Jessica Henwick playing Emma Stone's ""Wichita"")... Confusing?
Not really. It's a post-apocalyptic road trip monster filled action love story movie that is a romp and a riot.
It's not often you get to see a movie where even it's weakest link is still holding strong... The dialogue is witty, the scenery is beautiful but appropriate, CGI game is strong most of the time, and cinematography crisp & clear, no lightening cuts and shaky camera. All the cast brought their A-game.
Hero and Dodge lent so much emotion to their joint portrayal of ""Boy"" the dog, they both must be very good boys... and Mavis the robot could almost pass the Turing test.
You may have to suspend belief a bit in a couple scenes... But just remember you are watching a movie with giant frogs and snails and it shouldn't be too difficult. For me it's a 7 but a strong one."
tt2222042,"It's a lot like zombieland which is probebly one of my favourite films. The main character is not will smith or the rock, it's a skinny nobody. Dylan Obrien is amazing. The film is funny and the action is great. The monsters are also really cool. The dog is a badass. I'd love a sequel. more characters more worldbuilding stuff like that."
tt2222042,Great mocumentary depicting every day life in Australia.
tt2222042,"It's not the most expensive movie, or the best plot but honestly this movie gave me flashbacks to the good old days of family adventure movies.
It has adventure, it has love, it has companionship, it has humour and it keeps you wanting to learn more about the world. It makes you feel good."
tt2222042,"I enjoyed this way more than I expected. It has love, adventures and humanity in it."
tt2222042,"Finally, a fresh new plot with some good quality VFX applied in it."
tt2222042,"Right, well I had virtually no idea what I was getting into when I sat down to watch the 2020 movie ""Monster Problems"" (aka ""Love and Monsters""). But I must admit that I was genuinely interested in the movie given the presentation of the poster."
tt2222042,"This movie was fun to watch, the acting wasn't bad at all, CGI was decent.
Compared to Jumanji for example, which I found was a bit too much and overacted, this one is exactly what you would expect, but not too intense and forced.
Looking forward to a sequel."
tt2222042,"Love and Monsters was a fun film to see and it is actually after a some time a very fun new realease that surved its purpose and goals that it was trying to reach.Story was very inspiring and sweet at same time,it had some emotional moments and some romantic ones that were justified and that didnt felt rushed at any moment.Characters are also very likeable and i was able to root for them during entire runtime expecely towards the Dylan O Brien one,cause he was highlight of a entire film,special effects were also pretty solid and they done a good job to.Love and Monsters was a fun film to see for all families"
tt2222042,"An apocalyptic film without zombies is worth its weight in gold these days.
The monster were kinda silly, but the story, the pace and the character were pretty good.
Filming locations were also great and different from the usual Hollywoodian sameness.
And, Thanks God, there were no ""in your face"" PC proselytism, which was refreshing.
Love and Monsters is the type of a film that a father can watch with his daughter or a mother with her and son and without feeling embarrassed most of the time."
tt2222042,Really enjoyable movie and not as predictable as you'd think. I was surprised how funny and original 'Love and Monsters' was considering the overdone genre but it is an adventure worth taking. If you're looking for a decent weekend flick then I strongly recommend you give it a go.
tt2222042,"These hi-concept voice-over end of the world affairs do not always work, but the script here is smart enough to consistently play to basic human emotions and Obrien seems to have enough charm in the tank to power a battleship."
tt2222042,"I was prepared for another boring to death movie flick, making questioning my taste on movies. I was surprised in a good way.
The movie had it all, great FX, good acting, Monsters, unseen twists, everything i needed for a Saturday night."
tt2222042,"This is your typical family friendly adventure movie. It has a plain, simple plot (and don't try to put it through the ""credibility test"", because it will fail miserably), predictable and cliched. There's not a lot of character development either. It has some humor (not very good), and some heartwarming moments (kinda...). Overall it's entertaining (considering it's intended for kids and teens), but forgettable."
tt2222042,"Yes, this is a very entertaining movie. A teenage boy survives a global disaster and is in hiding with other survivors in underground bunkers. Yet, he cannot get his girlfriend out of his head, luckily his girlfriend also survived, but is at a camp 126km from his camp. He takes the journey to go to his girlfriend fighting mutated cold blooded animals and insects. The mutants are great, very well done. What this movie almost brings down is the childish script and jokes, the main character, the teenage boy, is constantly denigrated for no reason, even a little girl he meets on his journey insults him only for a couple of poor executed jokes. But, all in all, this movie is worth your while."
tt2222042,6/10 - unexpected sci-fi hit has good special effects but an unfulfilling story
tt2222042,"I am not sure if anyone is enjoying my riffs or how much sense some of the funny things I come up with as summary lines are making - or even if some consider them funny at all. Having said all that, the movie is funny. But even that can be judged differently by differnt individuals. The CGI work is really well done and the story is well thought of."
tt2222042,"I didn't expect much going into this film. It seemed like a generic and cheesy film, which at times it was, but there is a surprising amount of fun to be had with Love and Monsters."
tt2222042,"Bad news: Asteroid Agatha 616 is headed at Earth. Good News: Rockets are deployed to destroy the asteroid and succeed. Bad news: The fallout causes mutation in insects and cold blooded animals. Humans live underground in colonies. Our story focuses on Joel (Dylan O'Brien ) who freezes at the sight of a monster, even after seven years. He has been separated from his only teen love Aimee (Jessica Henwick) who is at another colony 85 dangerous surface miles away. Joel decides he wants to see her and starts out on a trek."
tt9340860,"After a family tragedy for the Blackledge family, grandparents George (Kevin Costner) and Margaret (Diane Lane) are left to bring up baby Jimmy (Bram and Otto Hornung) with mother/daughter-in-law Lorna (Kayli Carter). But a few years later, Lorna marries bad-un Donnie Weboy (Will Brittain) and disappears back to Donnie's hillbilly extended family in the wilds of North Dakota, led by the fearsome Blanche Weboy (Lesley Manville). Fearing for the child's wellbeing, Margaret drags retired Sheriff George on a dangerous journey to rescue the child."
tt9340860,"Both Costner and Lane are among our favorites, it is hard to find either of them in a bad or even lackluster role. Here they are a long time couple, he is a retired law enforcement professional. Set in the early 1960s, they live on a small horse ranch in Montana, they have a married adult son and a small grandson. In an unfortunate riding accident their son dies, the D. I. L. Remarries a couple of years later. Then the newlyweds leave town suddenly and without saying goodbye."
tt9340860,"A Throw-Back to the Now Virtually Extinct, Except in Low-Budget Experiments of New-Bee Film-Makers."
tt9340860,"Back in the 80's and 90's Kevin Costner was one of the biggest movie stars on the planet . He starred in some brilliant ( if not long ) movies but for some reason started to get a negative reputation and I'm not quite sure why . Perhaps Waterworld is to blame ? . Watching Let Him Ho you can see the man is still a very good actor but in this , he is outshone by two women."
tt9340860,"I didn't expect the story to be so dark and disturbing. It is probably too dark for me to enjoy, but it is still engaging."
tt9340860,"There was a point about a quarter of the way through 'Let Him Go' where I was questioning the protagonist's motives and whether they were entitled to be doing what they appeared to be trying to do. As if the film recognised this may be an issue with audiences, they then do an excellent job from that point onwards of justifying their actions. The characters created in this film on both sides of the ledger are excellent. The heroes are people we can genuinely root for and care about their fate, and the villains are truly horrendous people who we want to meet the worst fate."
tt9340860,"Like many I'm a BIG Costner fan. This one could easily have been a rugged but amiable Western drama, but, like the moth flying close to the flame it gets tinged by inflexions of horror - a disquieting experience for the unwary. The plot has at its center the 'kidnap by marriage' of aged Margaret and George's grandson, goaded on by another interestingly psychotic family of near in-laws, resembling to no small degree the Snell Family of Netflix's 'Ozark', though this time featuring North Dakota as that bastion of redneck eccentricity. On the good side, it's a terrifyingly real situation, acted out charmingly by Kevin Costner with his trademark reserve. But the movie was a little long, with those now clichÃ©d tropes, the sort that better directors do well to avoid."
tt9340860,"I hate slow burn movies n trust me dis one aint a slow burn at all.
It is a western drama aided by solid performances n amazing cinematography and the film does have some very intense scenes."
tt9340860,"Greetings again from the darkness. Diane Lane and Kevin Costner reunite on screen, only this time it's not as the earthy and earthly parents to Superman (MAN OF STEEL, 2013). Instead, this film from writer-director Thomas Bezucha (THE FAMILY STONE, 2005), based on Larry Watson's 2013 novel, features the two stars as long-time married couple, Margaret and George Blackledge, living a peaceful existence on their Montana ranch. Well, it's peaceful now, as George is retired from his career as a lawman."
tt9340860,"Great casting, cinematography, sets and location, but novice writer and director Thomas Bezucha made this one a very unnecessarily slow burner. The 113 runtime was way too long for this story, and felt twice as long with the slow pacing, long dragged out scenes and unnecessary still shots. If you watched this at 1.2x speed, it'd be bearable. The screenplay needed a good 20-30 mins edited/cut out. The sound/score could've also been better. Not sure if it was Costner's character, or he was bored during filming, because this wasn't one of his finest performances - by a long shot. Never mind all the bogus 9's and 10's, this is an honest and very generous 6/10 from me."
tt9340860,Let Him Go is a western-gothic crime thriller with a North Western setting and some resemblance to vintage oaters like The Searchers. The search has elemental film roots with mental and physical violence enhanced by Leslie Manville as a bad grandma and her wicked sons.
tt9340860,"This story is dark in many ways, but at the heart of it are two grieving grandparents (badass grandparents though) who want to save their toddler grandson from terrible criminals. Complex and thoughtful, it's the perfect mix of drama and suspense. Kevin Costner and Diane Lane are amazing. This is a finely drawn drama with high stakes tension."
tt9340860,"This new Western blends elements of noir, drama, and suspense to create a generally searing character study. Set in the 1960s, it tells the story of a retired sheriff (Kevin Costner) and his wife (Diane Lane.) Their young grandson has been spending time with his stepfather, whom they view as suspicious and is married to their son's widow. The leading couple leaves from Montana to the Dakotas to visit their step-family and try to get their grandson back, but things go south very quickly. The performances are generally powerful all around. Costner and Lane give clear emotional depth as well as a real sense of genuineness and urgency while in character. They feel haunted with grief from the death of their son, yet also proactively driven by a strong desire to ensure their grandson is properly treated. The film's cinematography of the Great Plains is gorgeous (although it was actually filmed in Alberta, Canada,) and the score is also quietly powerful."
tt9340860,But it goes something along the lines that - when an American novelist doesn't know how to end his story he just kills everyone off.
tt9340860,"Let's be crystal clear. Costner and Lane are so professional and interesting by themselves you could watch them build a garage and still be entertained. But movies have to more than the sum of their parts. Here Thomas Bezucha has written an abomination of a script where the real ""mystery"" -- why the girl married poorly in the first place -- takes place outside the narrative and off-camera almost before the opening titles. In these kinds of melodramas, there are usually story beats developed early on so, that when the climax comes, the audience is tuned in and feels satisfied. Bezucha doesn't care about his audience at all. He tells the story, it seems, to suit only himself. Just like the main villain that he created."
tt9340860,Kevin and Diane make a good movie couple and they go good together in this western drama set in the 60's. I wouldn't say this is a thriller as almost all the scenes are predictable once they start and the pace is quite slow. The scenery is a nice touch for people who haven't seen the Alberta/Montana area but it's not a reason to watch this.
tt9340860,"Dont believe the hype reviews about this MEH film. Diane Lane and Kevin Costner played the roles of two grandparents you just wanted slap and ask, WTF were you thinking? The story line was weak, the build up was off and the ending was ridiculous. The best part of the film was the score. I'm not sure what these other reviews are even talking about, especially saying Lane deserves and Oscar for this role....huh? Overrated reviews made me want to watch this MEH film. Dont believe them, this film was just ok"
tt9340860,3 out of 5 stars.
tt9340860,This was like watching Father Knows Best (salty version) meets MA Barker and her boys! It was a good story that moved along well with the beautiful backdrop of the mountains of the west. There was pathos and you connected with the characters. I like watching a movie geared towards 50+ year olds! Make more.
tt9340860,IN BRIEF: A Western drama that gets lost in the dust.
tt9340860,If you're a parent or grandparent this movie will touch a few nerves. The character development of our main characters are well written with an outstanding performance by Costner and Lane. However I feel like I needed to know more about our antagonists which were poorly written for the movie. It was difficult to understand the motives behind their actions and their drive to push back against our protagonists (without saying too much). Lots of questions left behind at the end but otherwise an enjoyable movie.
tt9340860,"Let Him Go (2020) is a movie we recently watched on a Delta flight on the way to a wedding. The storyline focuses on recent grandparents who lose their son in an unfortunate accident and their widowed daughter in-law marries an abusive man and then mysteriously moves away. When they believe their former daughter in-law and grandson are being abused they set out on a mission to rescue them. This movie is directed by Thomas Bezucha (Monte Carlo) and stars Kevin Costner (Dances with Wolves), Diane Lane (The Outsiders), Kayli Carter (Bad Education) and Greg Lawson (Heartland). The storyline for this is delivered in an outstanding and methodical manner. The cinematography of the landscape, each characters tragic past, how the grandparents fit together and appreciate each other, and how they work together (or don't) to accomplish their ultimate goals for the benefit of the family was wonderful. This movie was very well written, acted and put together. I strongly recommend this film and would score it a solid 9/10."
tt9340860,Not a bad TV movie but not worth paying to see at theatre.
tt9340860,"This is a strong film and a special one I'd say. How unusually unsatisfyingly it unravels, but yet you still totally want to see what happens next. The film is authentic feeling enough to really drag you into it, whether you like where it's going or not. I think for most mature audiences, it will affect them in this way for the most part. Thankfully this is not just another predictable Hollywood film. It certainly isn't unfamiliar territory, not at all, but it's certainly far more uncompromising and the characters are more realistic than most modern Hollywood films; And therefore the film is a breath of fresh air on this basis alone, even though the movies atmosphere is somewhat stifling. It seemed to me that this role was absolutely perfect for Diane Lane at this stage in her career/life. Or is it that she just totally embodied the character and nailed it? Definitely both! In my view anyway. And the Oscar goes to...if I was handing them out. She was amazing in this. I would even venture to say one of the better female performances I've seen out of Hollywood in the last many years. She was that good, and the part was also a pretty interesting one. Subtle and intense I think describe her performance the most accurately. Costner was definitely very understated and subtle himself in another very strong performance. My advice to those with mature viewing eyes, don't miss this film!"
tt9340860,"After losing their son, retired sheriff George(Kevin Costner) and his wife Margaret(Diane Lane) leave their Montana ranch to rescue their young grandson from the clutches of a dangerous family after their daughter in law remarriage. Diane lane and Kevin Costner play well Off each other. This being their third time working together the past seven years you can start to see that old married couple image with them. The first hour of the movie seems to drag for a bit . But once they find their grandson the movie picks up real quick."
tt7939766,The story gets increasingly more bizarre. There are no explanations or closures either. I honestly don't know what I watched.
tt7939766,"A young man invites his new girlfriend to drive out and meet his parents. A simple enough set-up for film, even if the title hints that all may not go well. But, in this fun-house mirror of a movie, all is not as it appears. Anyone familiar with the work of Charlie Kaufman (BEING JOHN MALKOVICH, SYNECDOCHE NEW YORK) won't either be surprised or expect anything else."
tt7939766,"The whole movie is a mix up of imagined and real memories in the janitors head, whom is Jake btw but the whole idea of the movie making us consecrate on the girl who's in fact only in his imagination mad eus believe she's the star!"
tt7939766,"First of all, the movie is about Jake, NOT the girl. She is a mere compliation of many girls he has dated. Snapshots of several failed relationships. Her thoughts are actually his, what he believes she's thinking about. When she starts thinking in a direction he doesn't like (or negative towards him) he interrupts, changes his thoughts. But I do encourage you to watch it again, focusing on him, leaving her as just a mish mash of his past but all the thoughts are really his. It will make MUCH more sense."
tt7939766,"Usually I recommend people to not watch or read reviews, just enjoy the film in their own way. This one, though, is better if you are well prepared for it. It's a two hour fifteen minute film that requires another twenty minutes for the obligatory YouTube video that explains what you've just seen. Foundflix has a nice Explained for it, but watch or read whatever. Because you need to understand you are going to sit through the slow, oh so slow, dissolution of a man's mind, complete with heavy references to books and films and musicals, awkward scenes that make you want to skip forward, long internal monologues, the whole thing. It is also worth mentioning that this film is based of a book, one that is not written by Kaufman, but right up his alley. You might want to check that out before attempting to see the film."
tt7939766,"This was such a struggle to get through, and very unrewarding for doing so."
tt7939766,"I understand why people dislike this movie. Most people don't like to be an active participant in what we've been trained to think of as a passive medium-and that's okay, but don't judge an ""active"" movie as poorly made just because you prefer ""passive"" ones."
tt7939766,To anyone who has no idea what they have just watched here is the opinion of someone who read the book (which helps a lot in understanding the movie).
tt7939766,"Charlie Kaufman channels David Lynch in this eerie, creepy relationship drama that really knows how to get under your skin."
tt7939766,"It's not an easy movie to get through and it is definitely one to divide the audience. The movie is labeled as a drama and thriller, which can be misleading because its more of a psychological horror. It delves into the mind of a lonely janitor (Jake) with themes of regret, loneliness, and ageism. I won't leave any spoilers for those who want to watch it, but word of advice....if you enjoy slow movies with deep philosophical conversations this is your movie. For those who are looking for jump scares and twists, skip it and save yourself 2 hours."
tt7939766,"I had the pleasure of reading Iain Reid's book a few years ago, and remember devouring it in practically one sitting. The biggest takeaway from me was the incredibly eerie tone throughout, the multitude of questions I had, and then the shocking plot twist that gave the title ""I'm Thinking of Ending Things"" an entirely new and powerful meaning.
I am a fan of Kaufman's work, and was excited when I learned he was adapting this wonderful, creepy, and thought-provoking book. However, after watching it, I feel like his entire approach to the novel was a big mistake and took away most of what made it an entertaining and powerful story.
So, before I go into my biggest problems with the way this was handled, I have to say that clearly most of my opinions are based on having read the book beforehand. Therefore, I genuinely cannot say how I would feel about this film if I didn't have that prior knowledge and comparison. Others may very well enjoy this film and think it strong, but compared to the book...well let's get into that."
tt7939766,I could only conclude this plays out in the mind of someone suffering immense mental torment coupled with severe psychiatric disorders - maybe that was the point!
tt7939766,"Although is it the mind or is it something else playing tricks on us? Or the main actress. We are literally inside her head - by hearing her thoughts throughout. And her thoughts alone that is. She really has some things she probably should get off her chest ... and she knows it. But does that all play a role? I rewatched portions of this movie,, because it is weird as ... well choose your own word you want there."
tt7939766,"Strange, bewildering & full of misgivings, I'm Thinking of Ending Things only gets more awkward & confusing as it progresses but it still creates enough intrigue for the viewers to stick around and see if the whole ordeal of sitting through the film is worth it in the end. Now I don't know about the others but my answer to that is a plain & simple no."
tt7939766,"The movie is about a ""jake"" and his girlfriend which is referred to as ""young woman"" and have many names throughout the movie. They are going to visit jake's parents for a one day trip and coming back again.
First act is the journey to the ""farmy"" area to jake's parents and how awkward it's between them and we hear the inner thought of the girlfriend wanting to ending things while being interrupted for a random yet confusing topics. I think Jessie Buckley carried that whole first act.
Second act is the arrival of them to his parents house and how they are welcoming her yet annoying Jake. And let me say that this act was bizarre and confusing and i think was the most bizarre act i have seen in a while.
Third act and after that rollercoaster of thriller and confusion is the journey back home or as we think it is and it does continue the rhythm of you thinking "" there is something wrong in this movie i can feel it ""."
tt7939766,"I think I've just accepted that I'm never going to be a Charlie Kaufman guy. He consistently makes films about an intriguing premise, but decides (very purposefully) to remove any sense of logic or the ability to comprehend the plot for the audience. Some people like films that you have to dissect long after viewing, but this is different. If you don't care about what's happening the first time around, there's no sense in taking the time to dissect it later on. One of the notes I wrote down in my notebook was ""nothing happened"". That's all you need to know."
tt7939766,"Greetings again from the darkness. We should never look to Charlie Kaufman to pull us out of the pandemic doldrums, although he is an absurdly talented writer who specializes in unusual plots and oddball characters. Mr. Kaufman is also an over-thinker and a non-stop thinker - I would imagine his brain rarely goes quiet. This time out, he directs his own adaptation of Iain Reid's novel, and the result is a mind and time bending existential crisis that leaves us feeling a bit down. Yet, as always, Kaufman's work keeps our minds racing."
tt7939766,"Although I was intrigued and interested by the whole story during the entire movie I can't say it is a good movie. It's much too confusing, you hope to get answers that you will never get and that's just not my idea of a good movie. It's just frustrating, certainly when you spend more than two hours trying to figure out what it's all about. That said if the story would have been explained correctly it could have been a good movie. The acting was really good, especially from Toni Collette which was my favorite. she has a smaller part but it reminded me of her character she played in the excellent series United States Of Tara. So it were not the actors that failed in this movie but the story and that's too bad because it had potential. I won't say I didn't enjoy most of the movie but for me there is a rule that a story has to be clear towards the end which is absolutely not the case here. I'm still wondering what I watched and probably never will get it."
tt7939766,"I would try to explain what I wasted over two hours of my life and time watching but that might only confuse you even more. With a good cast, especially the up and coming Jessie Buckley, I thought it would be something worthwhile watching, but I was so wrong. This isn't a Thriller at all but a nonsensical Drama/Musical. Don't bother with this one!"
tt7939766,"Another example of Charlie Kaufman's incoherent mess of a movie, but this time he even outdid himself. The movie demands a lot of questions without giving any answers. It's unwatchable at times, I barely got through the entire thing. It's hard to articulate how bad it is. It's not profound or clever or anything it was trying to be, it's just pointless. Don't waste your time trying to solve the puzzle, there isn't one to solve."
tt7939766,"Like all of Kaufman's work I'm Thinking of Ending Things simply doesn't tell its viewer what's actually happening, it offers open interpretations to each. After the first act, much of the film is ambiguous and dream like. The scenes are long and dialogue heavy throughout the film. Jessie Buckley and Jesse Plemons are exceptional as the film's lead actors but it was the supporting actors David Thewlis and Toni Collette who were at the top of their game."
tt7939766,"In this dismal year 2020 there must be a competition going on between Kaufmann and Nolan to make the most annoyingly pretentious movie. I suffered through Tenet because I paid for the ticket, but this was a different situation."
tt7939766,"While watching it, I literally have no clue what I was watching. I thought, maybe I will get all my anwsers at the end but I didn't. It is still mystery to me what the movie is about xD."
tt7939766,"Prolix, Pleonasm, Logorrhea, Verbose, Garrulous...
Kaufman babbles on and on, and on... his characters rambling incessantly in some beatnik manner that makes you want to cancel your Netflix subscription"
tt7939766,"This movie was so bad, 2 hours and 14 minutes of my life wasted....I'm thinking of not watching another movie for a month."
tt7939766,"I have seen countless psychological films and this one was absolutely terrible. The main actress was so irritating that it was difficult to get past any dialogue involving her. This movie tries so incredibly hard to be ""smart"", ""thought provoking"", and ""edgy"" that is just makes you angry because it's none of those things."
tt7939766,"This film start with the narrator talking about she thinking of ending things, and she talking about her boyfriend ""Jake"" scene! As turnout, this film is about a series of dream from a dementia janitor! Entire film too long, too slow, and full of annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the main actress murmuring scene, overuse of the singing scene, overuse of the dancing scene, and overuse of the song playing at the background scene! Make the film unwatchable! Barely intense scene is, a dancing bridegroom been stabbed! At the end, Jake receiving the award for curing dementia! That's it! Wasting time to watch!"
tt7939766,"The most slow and boring movie with conversations that last up to 30 minutes, MANY questions unanswered and confusing random parts for no reason at all
i was so excited for this one and have never felt so let down, a complete waste of 2 and a half hours without even any reasoning or learning point as all movies have and even theorists can't understand it"
tt7939766,"Pluses - the girl in the dance scene is gorgeous and the lead actor has a nice singing voice. Minuses - everything else. This movie makes absolutely no sense unless perhaps you've read the book, which I certainly wouldn't chance doing in case it's as bad as the movie. I will say the lead actors had to memorizes a ton of dialog, which was impressive, but there is nothing about this movie that would make me recommend it - well, maybe if you are having trouble sleeping, it might be beneficial."
tt7939766,"I knew going in that Charlie Kaufman is weird and his movies sometimes have unusual elements included to make a point, but I've always found them intriguing to some degree. So, for the first third of I'm Thinking of Ending Things, I was fully engaged and anxiously waiting to see what kind of weird twist he would add into this tale of a young couple going to visit the boyfriend's parents. It certainly seemed like something was slightly off, and I thought I was ready for anything. However, once I realized that there wasn't a real story being told and it was all just odd nonsense trying to make a point, I was thinking of ending things myself. All the air was let out of the balloon, and what was once eerily off-putting just pissed me off. It's the same kind of gobbledygook that David Lynch throws at the audience. Cobble together as much incomprehensible crap as you want, and no one can complain about the absurdity because it all takes place inside someone's mind (arguably someone who is going insane/senile.)"
tt7939766,"I like to think of myself as a reasonably well rounded cinema viewer. As happy in the arthouse as the multiplex and open to less literal experiences - but (you knew that was coming) I couldn't connect with ""I'm Thinking of Ending Things"". I think I understood it plot wise, but am less clear about what it was supposed to mean."
tt7939766,"It was weird. The first 15-20 minutes just seemed to drag. Great cast, but the storyline was not for me. Boring."
tt7939766,I think my favourite thing about this movie is how clever it is without being pretentious.
tt7939766,Such as removing this crap film from my mind. I love how people take crap and then say it means something. Movie means nothing. waste of good actors and actresses. If you wanta fall a sleep this is a perfect film to
tt7939766,"So we were okay with the first hour. Tension was building and we were curious to see what was going on. We were intrigued and wanted the movie to come full circle. Bad news, it did not. It's not good. Slow and boring and leads to nothing. The last 30 min make zero sense, no abstract explanation fits. It's just stupid. Art for arts sake, no point. Really very very bad. The last 30-45 min ruins the entire experience. It's not even a thriller. It's like stream of consciousness and weird, not in a good way. Please avoid it. It's not good."
tt7939766,"Charlie Kaufman knows how to translate the most purely human concerns and anxieties - often to do with perception, love, age, and just life itself - into something unthinkable, where each minute filmmaking choice (no matter how dreamlike) accentuates the characterizations and themes. His solo run as a director remains promising, and I'm Thinking of Ending Things possibly surpasses even Anomalisa."
tt7939766,"I'm soooooo tired of pompous writers and directors who try to make a point by delivering us a movie that goes all over the place and has scenes that make no sense at all. It's because they're afraid no one likes them, they aren't as smart as they think they are, they won't be remembered, any kind of phobia insert gere!! Het I have a suggestion make a fricking movie that entertains not bore you to death and then ends with complete lunacy. Dont think it can happen, go watch usual suspects, sixth sense, the crying game, the green mile, shawshank redemption, midnight special, titanic,tombstone, pans labyrinth, or pretty much any alfredo Hitchcock. Dont watch pieces if garbage like this. Oh and you movie lemmings quit saying a movie is good because someone else especially a critic says it is."
tt7939766,"Actually the more I think about this film the less I enjoy it. I keep thinking about how Kaufman could've made this one of the most upsetting/disturbing movies ever made. It's creepy, thats for sure. But instead, he chooses to simply thread surreal/disturbing set pieces together with ruminations on art and media that comes off as incredibly self indulgent. I get what he's going for, I understand why he does it. But it's not something that I walk away from satisfied. I simply walk away exhausted and slightly annoyed. The first half of the film is so brilliant in comparison to the last half. A meditation on the ugliness of a ""pathetic"", sad person's life, a meditation on memory and its destruction, on lost chances and false hopes, on the sheer ugliness of the maggots that feed on the underbelly of a life led wrong. The atmosphere was so thick it could be cut with a knife. The feeling of going inside an abandoned farmhouse during a blizzard that lacerates and seeing all the sad, desperate ghosts of the pasts walking along empty corridors on a loop looking for something but finding nothing. Its the emotions that the songs of The Caretaker evokes transferred into film format. But that second half slowly trails off into the annoying and self indulgent. I'm sorry, but I just don't think having a character recite the entirety of Pauline Kael's negative review of A Woman Under the Influnce for like six minutes is particularly clever or interesting, no matter how much Charlie Kaufman may think it is."
tt7939766,"I believe, the purpose of any movie is to either entertain the audience or to educate, sometimes
both. But movies like ""I'm Thinking of Ending Things"" opens up a third purpose too, which is to ""irritate"" the audience and that too as much as possible. I was attracted to this movie mainly because I loved Charlie Kaufman's works like ""eternal sunshine of a spotless mind"" and ""Being John Malkovich"" and I was severely penalised for it."

tt7939766,"I'm Thinking of Ending Things (2020) is a movie I recently caught on Netflix. The storyline focuses on a woman with a boyfriend who has abstract parents. She has issues saying no but wants to move on from her boyfriend. This encounter with his parents won't change those goals. This movie is directed by Charlie Kaufman, director of How and Why and writer of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. This picture stars Jesse Plemons (The Irishman), Jessie Buckley (Beast), Toni Collette (The Sixth Sense), Oliver Platt (Lake Placid) and David Thewlis (Wonder Woman). We watched this due to the references to Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind writer and the caliber of the cast, who I am a big fan of; that, and the reference this is a thriller/horror. First, it is not a thriller or a horror. Second, this tried to be clever by focusing on an individuals mental state but isn't executed well at all. Finally, the ending was abrupt and awful. Overall, there's nothing I like about this movie but the cast, who did what they could with this, which wasn't much. I'd score this a 1/10."
tt7939766,I have been waiting all year for this movie to come out!
tt7939766,I totally didn't get what it was I was watching and It all went straight over my head! So many things were happening and it didn't make any sense to me at all. I kept wondering what it was I was watching? So much of the movie is just them driving in the car in a snowstorm talking about random stuff.
tt7939766,"Do not waste your time watching this piece of psychedelic garbage. Nothing makes sense, you actually need a manual to understand what's going on. It's not fun, interesting, frightening just completely weird in the worst possible way.
Garbage belongs in the trash can. Not on Netflix. NFLX stock will drop like a rock if they continue stream such crap."
tt7939766,I'm here for slow cinema but this was truly a drag and a load of superfluous dialogue. A truly depressing waste of time.
tt7939766,"What a stupid waste of time with this bizzare bizzare movie!
Don't waste your time, watch something else."
tt7939766,"The hardest part about watching this movie was trying to figure out why I was watching it. At the end, I had to look up interpretations, which I think took a lot of the magic and reflection out of what a movie should be. I wish it would've been a little less abstract, for those of us who watched it independently from the book, and aren't abstract minded enough to pull meaning out of thin air."
tt10288566,"Teacher being myself, I saw this film for a sort of cure after a crazy pandemic school year and, no doubts , for Mads Mikkelsen ( like Martin, I am history teacher and very/ too familiar with the parents/ students pressions ). The film was more then I expected. Because it is a beautiful eulogy of freedom and fine portrait of teaching - the help for Sebastian from music teacher is just moving - , friendship, escape from fears / doubts/ routine, middle age crisis, pure forms of freedom . And, sure, a film about fall. I saw it as teacher , not as cinema critic, I loved the crazyness and realism, humor and dark slices, the moral and the splendid job of Mikkelsen."
tt10288566,"After giving the most emotional and heartbreaking Oscar speech of the recent awards, Thomas Vinterberg's International Feature winner is now in UK cinemas. ""Druk"" (Danish for ""Binge Drinking"") is in the Danish language with subtitles: but don't let that put you off."
tt10288566,"An intoxicating celebration of life and a sobering examination of midlife crisis that illuminates the inebriating delights & euphoric pleasures of alcohol influence with heart & humour without ever shying from the havoc it can cause when consumed in excess, Another Round (Druk) blends the elements of comedy, drama & tragedy into a vibrant, effervescent & invigorating mix, and is brilliantly spearheaded by a stellar showcase from the ever-reliable Mads Mikkelsen."
tt10288566,"Thomas Vinterberg's Academy Award-nominated ""Druk"" (""Another Round"" in English) looks at the role of alcoholic beverages in our lives, with a group of friends trying to maintain a constant blood-alcohol level. It's not a pro- or anti-alcohol movie; it simply shows the role that alcohol plays; the naturalistic cinematography adds to the tipsy feeling. Managing to cleverly fluctuate between funny and serious, the movie hits all the right notes while never turning mean. I'll be eager to see Vinterberg's next effort."
tt10288566,"Martin is a jaded history teacher. His relationship with his wife and family has also reached a point of staleness and his whole life seems to be one big bore. Similarly, his three best friends, teachers at the same school, have also reached a flat period in their lives. When one of them reads a theory that says that having a moderate degree of alcohol in your system at all times is a way to loosen up, they give it a go (for research purposes, of course!). It seems to work and they start upping the alcohol level. But what's the limit and what are the consequences?"
tt10288566,"There are two different films in 'Another Round' (the Danish title is 'Druk' which Google translates as 'Excessive Drink'), Thomas Vinterberg's 2020 film. One is about alcohol, its positive and negative effects, and how drinking is an integral part of the social life and culture of the community and perhaps of an entire people. The other is about a midlife crisis of four high school teachers who have each, in their own ways, come to a standstill in their personal and professional lives. Can alcohol be a solution? Up to what blood alcohol level? Can the morning after hangover be avoided?"
tt10288566,"Greetings again from the darkness. Oscar nominated for Best Foreign Language Film (Denmark), its director, Thomas Vinterberg was also nominated for Best Director. Mr. Vinterberg also directed the excellent 2012 film, THE HUNTING, and this time out, he collaborates yet again with his co-writer and lead actor from that film: Tobias Lindholm and Mads Mikkelsen, respectively."
tt10288566,"""Druk"" or ""Another Round"" is a Danish movie that premiered back in 2020 and now finally reached theaters here as well. And overall it was worth the wait I'd say. But first things first: The film is pretty much entirely in the Danish language and runs for slightly under two hours in the version I saw. The writer and director is Thomas Vinterberg and he made this film around the age of 50 and the man has been among Denmark's best filmmakers for quite some time now and this one here could very well propel him into the top spot. There has been a lot of quality from this little North European country in terms of movies lately, more than my country Germany can only dream of. This was one of the most lauded films this awards season. The movie was intended to be shown at Cannes first, but the pandemic got in the way. Otherwise, it would have been a huge contender there too. In any case, the film continues with its success greatly with all kinds of awards bodies, for example with a pretty much clean sweep at the European Film Awards and after Minari was not considered eligible for the foreign language category at the Oscars, there was pretty much zero doubt that this one takes the prize. Otherwise, it might have been a closer contest. Speaking of the Oscars, director Vinterberg himself was nominated here for his work behind the camera and that came as a bit of a surprise for sure. I would not call him undeserving, but I am also not sure if I think he was really deserving of that honor. Anyway, with Vinterberg there was a special story this awards season that is linked to death as well, namely when he lost one of his children under tragic circumstances. Not something that inspired this film though if I remember correctly. But still my sympathies to him."
tt10288566,"""Another Round"" or the Danish title ""Druk"" was a cinematic masterwork that has one of the greatest intellectual pleasant plot twists I have ever watched in my entire life, In the first hour of the movie I thought that it will depict and focus on the Danish alcohol culture, But the intricate plot had me recollecting my thoughts on the notions I acquired from Soren Kierkegaard's existential philosophy that interprets the dialogue in the movie and some of the scenes (Especially the ending)."
tt10288566,I originally had this rated at a 9/10... until the scene where Mads did an entire dance routine. That alone bumped it up to a perfect score.
tt10288566,TIFF 2020 09
tt10288566,"...but a fourth gets soaked then wrecked. The male mid-life crisis crutch proves once again to be nothing more than an empty vessel, albeit a more than capable form of transport as it masks the wailing sirens from four close friends and sails them perilously close to jagged and rocky coastlines. The easy way out but the hardest way back in, and all because being human, sharing emotions, making the wrong assumptions, breaking habits, opening up and being courageous is so much harder than unscrewing a bottle top or popping a cork. A brilliant piece of cinema with some exceptional performances and direction - SkÃ¥l."
tt10288566,"I went to watch this movie, hoping it wouldn't be either moralizing or celebrating of Danish drinking-culture - and fortunately it delivered!
Well I don't believe it was fortune or luck, but rather a deeply thought through film from Vinterberg. Before I went to watch it I saw a couple of interviews with the director to get a grasp of his vision. He emphasized that the quote at the beginning was in many ways the key to understand the film itself.
""What is youth? A dream. What is love? The dream's content"" - Kierkegaard
Thus it is not so much about drinking, but rather it tackles the reason for all the drinking. It is about the longing for youth - a state of hope, love and vitality. We long to live life to its fullest, but we seem unable to embody that in our own lives, so we succumb to cheap methods, such as drinking. Notice how throughout the movie there is an underlying sense of depression and misery, especially in the character Martin. He attempts to fix his whole life through drinking, and it initially works, but he is unable to control it. It is not untill the last moments, where his whole life is in ruins, and his alienated wife finally admits that she still misses him that hope shines on him. Only then can he dance!
It shows us how hope, love and vitality isn't found at the bottom of a bottle, it is found in our most meaningful relationships and our endeavors to hold on to them! It isn't the beer that enables him in the end, it is that text from Anika.
Thus we see that drinking can be a wonderful thing as well, as long as it isn't the very thing that keeps us going in itself (Tommy's demise!). It is love and courage and daring to fail and to fall that should be our driving force, and sometimes that one drink can be the little nudge we need to embody these ideals (the student at the exam - about Kierkegaard!!), but it shouldn't be at the center of our motivation in life."
tt10288566,"Druk (or Another Round for the English title) by Thomas Vinterberg is a refreshing story about alcohol consumption, about the effects alcohol has on the mood of a person, on the changing behavior, positive and/or negative, someone has under influence. It's and interesting and entertaining story that will keep your attention. I recognized some scenes from personal experiences, like anyone will that likes to have a drink occasionaly or addictively. The whole cast did a great job playing their characters. I didn't know any of the actors besides Mads Mikkelsen, that in my humble opinion always delivers, but they all did a good job making this movie worth watching."
tt10288566,"I saw a few mediocre reviews, which describes the movie as celebrating alcohol culture, hence why giving a mediocre score. Which is absolutely not true, and a misunderstanding. Maybe these persons comes from a society with less alcohol consumption, and see this as an unrealistic way of inciting a society to drink more.
The movie is in my opinion more likely criticizing the alcohol culture in Denmark, as it perfectly portrays the danish alcohol culture and how absurd it is, which makes what is actually a drama genre movie to become somewhat of a comedy, because it is so realistic, and the realism is just hilarious thought-provoking."
tt10288566,"This is a drama digging deep into the mundane numbness of everyday life. It also digs into the human relationship with alcohol. Then, it digs into the intertwining of these. Do not expect a comedy. I made the mistake of believing that this would be a comedy, which it wasn't. I wouldn't even say that this is a light-hearted drama, either. Some scenes hit heavy and were just tragic to watch."
tt10288566,Same case.
tt10288566,"I had a few misgivings about watching this film as someone who has not had a sip of alcohol in over six months. Would it trigger me into drinking? Would it portray drinking in a positive light? Obviously I threw my doubts aside and watched it and I am glad I did. This film primarily tells the tale of Martin (Mads Mikkelsen) who is going through the motions of life. He is no longer effective as a teacher and his family life is lacking due to the alienation of his wife and kids. However, on a boozy night out with a group of co-workers / friends an idea is formed, based on Norwegian philosopher and psychologist Finn SkÃ¥rderud's theory that humans are born with a blood alcohol level 0.050 lower than it should be, and that that amount should be drunk every day in order to bring about optimum performance levels. As all four friends engage in drinking in the morning things appear to work well, until the inevitable escalation. First off, this film is genuinely funny. Secondly, it is moving. Third, it is beautiful to look at. However if I were to judge this film as person who has a troubling relationship with alcohol and try to pinpoint a message to the film, then I would have some trouble. I believe the film is a commentary on the absurdity of Danish drinking culture. Not being Danish I maybe can't fully comprehend the social intricacies, but being British I can certainly understand (drinking is our culture). For better or worse this film doesn't appear to state definitively whether drinking alcohol is good or bad. Certainly you view tragedy born from over imbibing, but then it shows that there are some positives. For someone like me who wishes to moderate but can't and wants a binary judgement, this rubs me the wrong way."
tt10288566,"Most films that deal with the demon drink have been po-faced manifestos on the dangers of alcohol and there are very few films that celebrate drunkeness and those that do usually do so for comic effect. Thomas Vinterberg's ""Another Round"" is something of a rare exception. It's a film about drinking to excess that's indeed both funny and tragic in equal measure as it explores the theory that we all seem to have a blood alcohol level that is 0.05% too low and that we should drink enough, during daylight hours at least, to raise it to that level, where 'psychologically' we should all be at our best."
tt10288566,Just watch it. The synergy amongst the actors and director is awesome. When watching it you realize how realistic it actually is. This could happen right now in any Danish highschool or office.
tt10288566,"This Danish film (also titled Druk, which means ""binge drinking"") is one I found out about from Awards Season, the leading actor was a big draw for me, but it did also sound like an interesting story, from Oscar, BAFTA, and Golden Globe nominated director Thomas Vinterberg (Festen, The Hunt, Far from the Madding Crowd). Basically, teachers Martin (BAFTA nominated Mads Mikkelsen), Tommy (Thomas Bo Larsen), Peter (Lars Ranthe) and Nikolaj (Magnus Millang) are colleagues and friends at a high school in Copenhagen. All four struggle with unmotivated students and feel that their lives have become boring and uneventful. At a dinner celebrating Nikolaj's 40th birthday, the group discuss a theory by psychiatrist Finn SkÃ¥rderud, that having a blood alcohol content (BAC) of 0.05 makes you more creative and relaxed. While the group dismisses the theory, Martin, who is depressed due to his marriage failing, is inspired and starts to drink at work. The rest of the group
eventually decides to join him, noting their experiences as an experiment to test SkÃ¥rderud's theory. They agree to a set of rules: their BAC should never be below 0.05 and that they should not drink after 8:00pm. Within a short period of time, Martin, Tommy, Peter and Nikolaj find both their work and private lives more enjoyable. Martin particularly is delighted that he is finally managing to reconnect with his wife and children. The group find this positivity a reason to agree to take the experiment further, and the four increase the daily BAC limit to 0.10. Continuing to find their lives improved, the group decides to attempt binge drinking to observe how their bodies and minds respond. They all have a fun night, but after coming home drunk, both Martin and Nikolaj are confronted by their families. Martin's family express their worries that he is becoming an alcoholic, saying that he has been noticeably drunk for weeks. Martin and his wife Anika (Marie Bonnevie) have a heated argument, during which she admits to infidelity, and Martin leaves her. The group soon experience the negative consequences of the experiment and abandon it. Months later, all the members of the group have stopped drinking during the day except for Tommy, who has become an alcoholic. On day at work whilst drunk, Tommy boards his boat with his dog, he sails out on the ocean and dies in an accident. Following Tommy's funeral, the three remaining friends go out to dinner and are reluctant to drink the alcohol which is served. While dining, Martin receives a message from his wife who tells him that she is willing to give their marriage another chance. Martin, Peter and Nikolaj join the recently graduated students in celebrating and allow themselves to drink again while the partying takes place at the harbour. Martin, a former jazz ballet dancer, had for some time been urged by colleagues and refused to dance. In high spirits and influenced by the alcohol, Martin dances with the students and guests. His dance becomes increasingly energetic and joyous, and it ends as he leaps into the water, on a freeze frame of him in mid-air. Also starring Susse Wold as Rektor. Mikkelsen and his three co-stars give convincing performances as the drunken chums who find a new lease of life, their lessons whilst tipsy in the classroom and in the outdoors are fun to watch, with clever camerawork to capture the controlled inebriation and emotional moments, and it has both amusing and dramatic scenes that keep things moving nicely, a great comedy-drama. It won the Oscar for Best International Feature Film, it won the BAFTA for Best Film Not in the English Language, and Best Original Screenplay, and it Golden Globe was Best Motion Picture - Foreign Language. Very good!"
tt10288566,"I went to the cinema today to watch my third movie from Thomas Vinterberg, after watching ""The Celebration""(1998) and ""The Hunt""(2012) i had huge expectations for this movie. And i have to say that i got surprised even more than i thought was possible."
tt10288566,"This film from Thomas Vinterberg is well made with good performances, but it weirdly suffers from being both predictable (drinking too much inevitably leading to negative consequences) and from glamorizing alcohol use (for both kids and middle-aged men). You could say that's a good thing, that a black and white view is not presented, or that it accurately reflects Danish culture, but it just seemed kind of off, or in any event, it wasn't very compelling to me. I liked the score with its interesting mix of songs, and Mads Mikkelsen's dance moves. Overall, though, I didn't think it was particularly honest about the experiment the teachers embark on or the main character's trajectory, with that joyful ending. It seemed like it wanted to have it both ways, and would have been better remaining a dark statement on the culture of drinking, from adolescence through adulthood."
tt10288566,"This movie certainly has its moments, but it's kinda hazy with its premise. The mid-life crisis is played out pretty well. However, the remedy goes from subtle to nuclear in what seems to be a few days. I may be missing the point, but how do we go from using alcohol as and enhancement, too full blown alcoholism, in what seem like a small period of time. It may have well been a long period of time, but the movie didn't give it that feel."
tt10288566,"Thomas Vinterberg tells perfect stories of what alcohol can do.
As a result of problems with teaching, private life, and general happiness - Four high school teachers agree to try an experiment exploring alcohol's influence. What happens when maintaining a constant promille of 0.5?
Martin(Mads Mikkelsen) is the lead role, and the one we follow the most. He has an outstanding performance.
The movie executes well to not have a biased opinion on drinking, but show the whole picture."
tt9214832,"Emma. (2020) was directed by Autumn de Wilde. Jane Austen's novel was published in 1815. Two hundred years later, the novel still is wonderful. (OK--not Jane Austen's best novel, but still wonderful.)"
tt9214832,Emma is one of my favorite Jane Austin novels. This production is a travesty overall. The costumes and hair and locations are sumptuous and beautiful but do little to cover the fact that the director and perhaps lead actress did not understand the book at all.
tt9214832,"Some fatal attraction means I must watch new Jane Austen screen adaptations although I find them invariably less than satisfying. This version of Emma is no exception as its faults are egregious. I could tell almost straight away it was going to be gimmicky in the way that filmmakers of dubious merit think they can add bits of business to wonderful classics, or distort things completely, as an ""improvement"". I fantasize that, in a better world, there might be some court to hear applications to make screen adaptations, to determine whether the filmmaker actually understands what it is about the story and the characters that give these works of literature their timeless appeal. So often they don't, as they change and destroy what is so fundamental to the success of the original. Somebody give them a ""Cliff's Notes"" to read, at the very least!
Emma Woodhouse, the heroine of ""Emma"" is a likeable, open-natured young woman, who has faults but learns to become a better person. That's in the novel, anyway. The Emma depicted in this film wears alternately an arrogant or sulky expression, seems to have selfish and nasty motives and thoroughly deserves to be taken down a peg, which more or less happens. Newsflash to the filmmaker - she is such an unpleasant person that I don't care. Mr Knightley is a calm, confident sophisticated man of the world, someone of deep and genuine feelings - and dead sexy with it. Johnny Flynn's version is a nice young man but something of a klutz. How does he even like this hardfaced Emma? - again you've lost me. I have to contrast the failure of the lead characters to pull their weight in delivering the story, with the Romola Garai/Jonny Lee Miller version where they got it so right.
To carry on with the catalogue of ""wrongness"" in this version, Frank Churchill, an important and attractive character in the story, is presented by an actor lacking in looks and charm, a complete nonentity. To mention some minor characters, I fully expected Bill Nighy to ham it up with the Mr Woodhouse character, and he does. But why oh why do they have to make Emma's sister Isabella and brother-in-law John Knightley unpleasant and unhappy people - it's so wrong! While not a major theme, their domestic happiness is a beacon to Emma and Mr Knightley to follow their example, and recognize their destiny. I could go on - Harriet Smith isn't pretty, Miss Bates isn't talkative enough, and Mr Elton is a grinning gargoyle. If I pull myself up with an effort to acknowledge the positives of the film, there are beautiful landscapes and house interiors, and great costumes and hairstyles, real eye candy. The dialogue is reasonably respectful of the original. But I wasn't happy for a minute watching the film. I am entitled to have high expectations of a Jane Austen adaptation, and was majorly disappointed, so only a 4/10."
tt9214832,"Autumn de Wilde's Emma, with Anya Taylor-Joy and Johnny Flynn, is not my cup of tea, I'm afraid. My review might be influenced by how much I love Jane Austen's novel and how many times I've watched the 2009 miniseries, but I always give every adaptation a try. And I can't really judge if what I was watching would make sense to an Austen virgin, shall we say, so what seemed disjointed and rushed to me might work perfectly for others."
tt9214832,"I generally refuse to review a film I have not watched in its entirety and really dislike reviews in which reviewers say they turned the film off. In my estimation, how can you know the totality of a film enough to review it, if you did not see it all the way through? I believe I now understand."
tt9214832,This was the last movie my wife and I saw in the actual theater-- back in March 2020 -- just days before covid-19 lockdown began. As of July we're wondering when we'll ever get to see another. In the meantime we've acquired a big UHD TV and subscriptions to a bunch of streaming services. But there's still nothing to match watching on a big screen with a packed audience of engaged viewers.
tt9214832,"This recent film rendition of Jane Austen's Emma (curiously here called ""Emma."" With a period) enjoyably carries the opulence of the 19th century landed gentry with a modernist modicum of biting satire. This vintage Austen is critical of the heavy-handed social manipulations toward marriage while it exudes Austen's own marriage to the time. As Virginia Woolf said, Austen ""had no wish for things to be other than they are."""
tt9214832,"Based on a timeless novel Emma by Jane Austen, this latest movie adaptation of her book is a beautiful, gorgeous and entertaining re-make that should easily please Austen fans old and new as it looks phenomenal. Its cast, led by the terrific and wonderful Anya Taylor-Joy, are/is utterly splendid. ""Emma's"" script is adapted by novelist Eleanor Catton (The Luminaries) and manages to capture much of Austen's own comedy, translating it elegantly to the screen. The result is a stylish and eminently watchable movie adaptation. In addition to the script, the production values are stellar, while movie is visually stunning and impeccably researched - it really felt like an authentic window into the 1800s. At the end, film - updated in all the right ways - is filled with an abundance of genuine charm. For those who are fans of the period drama this is a must see, while this gentle film, also, deserves to introduce Austen to a whole new generation."
tt9214832,"This movie is beautiful to look at. The shots of the English countryside, the beautiful homes, the costumes. Some of the actors are even even easy on the eyes, especially Anya Taylor-Joy, the Emma, who is also a fine actress, and really creates a character."
tt9214832,"I resisted seeing seeing this movie at first. I have read Jane Austen's novel, and seen three other versions, including Amy Heckerling's funny updating, CLUELESS (1995). Did I need to see another film in which a rich, entitled young woman discovers she does not know how to rule herself, let alone the world?"
tt9214832,"I loved the look of ""Emma"" from the trailer. And I was not disappointed. It is a simply sublime piece of comic entertainment."
tt9214832,"Recently got a chance to watch this. I like the film with Gwyneth Paltrow, and absolutely love the BBC miniseries, so I was cautious watching this, especially with the several bad reviews. I don't know if it was because I went in with low expectations, but I was delighted by this movie! Admittedly if you don't know the story, it can move fast, but to be fair, the book is long and tedious, with a lot to fit in two hours, which is one of my problems with the 2008 movie. The visuals and fashions of this movie are beautiful, and Emma's character did show improvement unlike some of the comments I saw. This one definitely captured Jane Austen's humor, and you can be guaranteed to laugh a few times. The BBC mini-series is still my top rated, but the 2020 ""Emma."" is, in my opinion, a notch above the 2008 ""Emma"", but would definitely recommend all adaptations, especially the book."
tt9214832,"Can a movie manage to keep audience attention solely through its visuals, glorious costumes and splendid cinematography ? The answer is obviously no. The movie needs an engrossing narrative, interesting dialogue, realistic acting among other things which captivates the average audience. Sadly this film adaptation of a classic tale leaves much to be desired. You will be better off seeing the 1996 film with Gwynneth Paltrow which was far more absorbing. Or you can settle down with Greta Gerwig's "" Little women"" which you will definitely enjoy more."
tt9214832,"I have previously seen three TV versions of Emma, and the 1990s Hollywood film with Gwyneth Paltrow - which I find excessively sentimental. Emma is not my favourite Austen novel, but the adaptation used for the 2020 film version is generally very good. One or two specifics are omitted, but this is inevitable in compression to the running time of just over two hours."
tt9214832,"My goodness. Have read some reviews and I see no middle ground....2s or 9s..Someone mentions that Mr. Elton is a caricature...this is true so was Mr. Collins. Methinks, Ms. Austen liked to poke fun at the clergy."
tt9214832,"This initially seemed promising.However after half an hour the film started to drag.Pointless scene followed pointless scene.I sat there hoping for something to happen,but really little did."
tt9214832,Visually beautiful...but empty of soul....really dreadful...Emma (the lead) was particularly awful....save your time/money--see other versions..this one was torture to sit through
tt9214832,Aaand here we have another misinterpretation of Jane Austen's Emma.
tt9214832,"Emma: A new adaptation by Director Autumn de Wilde work from a script by Elanor Catton takes the Comedy of Manners/Drama road. Class is all important, to keep Emma's life on track a pyramid of servants is essential. Even when Emma (Anya Taylor-Joy) is picking flowers for her departing governess (Gemma Whelan) she requires the assistance of a footman and maid. Her father (Bill Nighy) needs two servants to detect draughts and move screens for him. Even the younger males like George Knightley (Johnny Flynn) have valets to dress them from head to foot."
tt9214832,"Unfortunately for me, this version of Emma was more a miss than a hit. It was too slow & failed to draw me in. Some of the scenes were just too long or superfluous, making me wish for them to hurry up to get to the good bits. Visually speaking it was lovely & depicted the Regency period well. But the soundtrack was often jarring & distracting rather than enhancing a scene. The odd choir singing is a case in point."
tt9214832,"Beautiful period piece with love and charm throughout! So delightful the way everything is set up, I love Anya Taylor Joy she's a wonderful actress in any project. Elegance of great magnitude and tranquillity. Emma deserves better/more appreciation; I'm barely a fan of period pieces but this is definitely among the best."
tt9214832,"This is not good.
Casting issues : Mr Knightley should have been much older. It would have helped if the actors playing Frank Churchill and Mr Elton did not look like twins.
What was the weird Handmaid's Tale red cloaked girls about?
Worst thing was that Emma was so damned horrible that it was inconceivable that anyone would like her let alone want to marry her, she was vile!
Really odd soundtrack did not help. The whole thing was a total miss. Badly and lazily put together.
However, the best thing was Mirsnda Hart who was both funny and vulnerable, a touchingly tender performance."
tt9214832,"The cast are perfection, the settings sublime and the social observation is as 'Austen' as any Austen I've seen. Yes, this new version of ""Emma"" is really quite wonderful and I would venture to say even a step up on the 1996 Douglas McGrath version. My only real quibble is that Anya Taylor-Joy, fine as she is, can't quite match Gwyneth Paltrow. Otherwise, what's not to love; a Knightly who isn't too suave or too handsome, (Johnny Flynn, splendid), a Frank Churchill who actually is something of a charmer and nowhere near as obnoxioous as he's often painted, (an excellent Callum Turner), and a gorgeously obsequious Mr. Elton from Josh O'Connor who just about walks off with the film while director Autumn de Wilde, (love that name), keeps it very nicely in period , (none of those little post-modern nods that now seem to be common in pictures of this kind). I also loved her use of English folk song on the soundtrack but this was just the icing on a very sweet cake. This is Jane Austen the way Jane Austen should be done."
tt9214832,"I think my title says it all, but I'll go ahead and give my two cents. I dearly love Jane Austen's books, reading them over and again, and have very easily fallen in love with the many movies based on them, the previous Emma films notwithstanding. Certainly every Emma filmmaker has taken his liberties with the story, but has made us fall in love with the characters while staying true to the heart of book. This film, however, took some liberties which neglected to enhance the film and rather were less necessary than the need to include more from the book itself. Some very strong, modern attributes were given to the women, which were uncharacteristic of Austen's time and certainly of her characters. I don't see the need for nudity and extended kissing scenes which are an affront to the purity of Jane Austen's works. Too much was taken out of the story and too many liberties were taken with it to garner any respect for it or desire to see it again. It created an ""uncomfortableness"" with the characters in many aspects, not the least of which lies in the the choice of actors, whose appearance and demeanor were very difficult to connect to their prospective characters. Additionally, this film swept through each scene with breathless rapidity, abruptly moving from one to the next resulting in a feeling of anxiety and restlessness and disabling the viewer from truly and deeply emotionally connecting with the characters. I think I will return to one of the classic tellings to cleanse my brain of this atrocity."
tt9214832,The latest version of Emma is like the previous one released in the cinema back in 1996.
tt1502397,"How does this Bad Boys sequel gets such a high rating? There's clearly some cheating going on with those ratings. Bad Boys For Life is without a doubt the worst movie of this franchise. I did enjoy the early Bad Boys so I thought this one would be in the same lineage but all I got was irritation. I don't know who wrote this script but it's cringing to watch at times. We're used to overly exaggerated action scenes in this kind of movies but here it just gets ridiculous. The chemistry between Will Smith and the normally always funny Martin Lawrence is completely lost. I could count the funny moments on one hand, and even with those I had to force a smile. I can't say I did enjoy this movie, I was glad when I saw the end credits appearing, and I sincerely hope that they will close this chapter forever. We don't need another Bad Boys."
tt1502397,I never thought I would say this...but I wish Michael Bay had directed this. Maybe the earlier entries hold something dear to his heart and he wouldn't have allowed this to go off the rails.
tt1502397,Boring to the point that it makes you fall asleep. Any attempt at humour falls flat. The supporting cast feels like cameos rather than characters that adds to the story.
tt1502397,"I can't remember the last time I saw a movie this bad in the theatre. I didn't smile once. Bad humor. Lawrence has never been funny and now he's so old and fat, he can barely move. Watch as they cut away every time he takes more than four steps; probably because he was out of breath. Smith is as usual Smith but he can't do anything with the 4th grade script. The action scenes are boring and stupid. Any rational adult claiming to line this should be ashamed and embarrassed. For the knuckle dragging Fast and Furious fans only. What an abomination."
tt1502397,Sometimes its better to be remembered for what once was. Bad Boys for Life being a case in question.
tt1502397,"Man, this movie completely sucked balls. I can't think of a worse movie I've ever seen. Easily the most predictable movie ever. Will Smith gets badly shot 10 minutes into the movie...is he gonna make it through?!?! Aw, man, no way...he made it! You don't say! Martin Lawrence...""No, no no, I'm not helping you any more Mike Lowery...I made a promise to God...No, no, no...I'm retired"" - I looked over at my buddy at one point and I said ""Uh...I think he's gonna help"". It was really that pathetically predictable."
tt1502397,The plot is very predictable even though there are a load of mistakes when referencing the earlier movies.
tt1502397,"You know the drill. Sony arranged a board meeting:

tt1502397,"A { - micro - } review .
___________________________________________________"
tt1502397,"A terrible movie.
Script horrible! Numerous goofs! Did they get paid for this? Not even entertaining. No acting....just fooling around. Plot? Copied and predictable. I'm nauseated."
tt1502397,"I have to admit i was'nt expecting much ,i'd already seen the first two which i did like .So i figured why make another one after all this time ? But i was pleasantly suprised .It is a very good movie with a good twist ,definelty add this to my dvd collection."
tt1502397,"This is one of those sequels which we did not need.
A bunch of endless shooting, unnecessary chases, senseless action. This is all there is to this movie. The acting is boring, the writing is horrible and story is even worse. It is heartbreaking to see that this movie has a rating of 7. It is an insult to cinema.
Save your time and money. STAY AWAY from bad boys FOR LIFE!!!"
tt1502397,Tbh you don't need to see the previous two movies as this was a great watch and you were drawn into the movie straight away . For me personally it was the best of the lot .
tt1502397,"After all these years the chemistry is still the same and at it's brilliant best. Story line was better than I thought and a rollercoaster of emotions that I didn't expect. Brilliant, brilliant film."
tt1502397,"This was a disappointing movie all around. The action, jokes, and even chemistry between Martin and Will felt forced as if they were going through the motions. The director seemed like he was trying to be Michael Bay but couldn't quite make it. Marcus was even more of a vagina (censored it) than usual and gets less action than ever before. The ride together mantra that seems constantly repeated throughout the film made it feel like I was watching a boring version of a Fast and Furious movie. Make no mistake I love the Bad Boys franchise. But this film is a weak watered-down version of Bad Boys. If they do make a part 4 which they are alluding to I certainly hope they make it better than this one."
tt1502397,The plot is really the same for the people who watched Bad Boys 1 and 2 (this would be a great place to start for those who haven't as the other 2 are quite old). Acting still is one of the greater. I enjoyed the jokes and the goofy scenes in between sticky situations. Sad to think that the majority of people hate this movie.
tt1502397,"This feels lethargic and sluggish, its a smack in the face of the fast paced energetic first two. The leads look tired, the dialogue is 90's TV at best and the plot is laughable. Got no interest in a 4th if this is where its going."
tt1502397,"Man, this was tedious. Just a dull, humourless, cheap, rehash of old plots and tired formulas."
tt1502397,"I love these films and this is nowhere close to the 1st two. It doesnt even feel like a BB's movie. Its sluggish unfunny with a tv movie feel about it.
The chemistry between Will Smith and Martin Lawrence is not there as nearly every joke is flat and feels like its trying REAL hard. The original cast just looks tired and in most scenes it feels it. Its a darker movie that drowns in despair for large part of the film and Smith and Lawrence dont have the comedy sparring of old to balance it out.
Believe me this is not a 10, its barely a 4.
For me its BB's 1 and 2 and thats when it ended. Sadly"
tt1502397,"What an excellent and funny movie to watch. I enjoyed this movie a lot, made me laugh and really appreciate the work and all the people that made this Masterpiece. Will & Martin give one of the best combos ever and with their professional performances, this movie is exciting, funny and fun to watch every second, really recommend thisðð¾"
tt1502397,"Bad Boys for Life will make you laugh at the jokes while the action sequences keep you on the edge of your seat. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are terrific in this third installment, and they still got it with their hilarious interactions. Jerry Bruckheimer, the producer never disappoints when it comes to action movies and it looks like a fourth movie is in the works."
tt1502397,"ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT is what comes to mind when i think of the 3rd film in the excellent Bad Boys Trilogy!!! I'm a life long Will Smith fan & have been since the very early 90's & Will Smith is my all time favourite actor & i was so excited when it was announced by Smith & Lawrence that they're back for a 3rd film. I really feel like i grew up with these characters as i watched the first Bad Boys over & over on video bk in the 90's, so i have big Nostalgia love for Will Smith as Mike & Martin Lawrence as Marcus. There's definitely a loving heartbeat to this entry as we see our favourite buddy cops operate in our modern times that's full of futuristic technology & new ways of policing using gadgets & new young blood on the police force that are all tech savvy & our old school cops still wanna do what they do best in their old school ways. A change of times & our cops are aging & have lost a step or two but their hearts are always in the right place. I loved the story here, the script, the look of the movie, the music & the emotional weight of the piece. Martin Lawrence gives the best performance of his Career & Will is excellent & gives the feel that his kick-ass legendary Bad Boy Lowry is trying so hard to still be who is was but in a totally different modernised world. You get the feel to that Will is trying to hang on to his action star image as an ageing actor & i love him even more for being so vulnerable here. Truly a terrific actor & an incredible performance. No actor has ever meant more to me than Will Smith."

tt1502397,Bad boy! Chemistry and definitely funny bandits of actions!
tt1502397,"Just Bad , like realy bad, like realy realy bad. Bad story, bad directing compared with realy bad jokes."
tt1502397,"Went in not expecting much...but wow it blew me away! Will and Martin, of course, are hilarious, but the other core characters make this movie a whole new jumping off place. Vanessa Hudgens is truly becoming a better actress every time I see her, Joe Pantiliano is always a great addition to any movie. I did not even recognize Alexander Ludwig, since he looks so different when he was younger. Kate del Castillo, Charles Melton, Theresa Randle, etc., etc. make this move a must see. Tons of action, great motorcycles....cannot wait for the next one."
tt1502397,"Amazing new sequel, hopefully not thenlast although it seems it is. As usual superb plot, loads of fun and action and epic representation of the two hero characters. Thumbs up."
tt1502397,Will Smith and Martin Lawrence steal the show with other talented actors and some eye candy along the way with good budget action. I cant give away too much but this movie was great and lived up to the hype of Bad Boys 1 and 2 respectively.
tt1502397,"Bad Boys for Life is definitely better than you would expect. Returning to screens 17 years after Bad Boys II, Smith and Lawrence are still a terrific pairing with great comedic chemistry. However, this threequel manages to pack in more heart and maturity than its predecessors. Bad Boys for Life brings all of the explosive fun the series is known for, but takes the franchise in new and exciting directions by choosing to be more reflective in nature."
tt1502397,"Review:
'Bad Boys for Life' is an action-comedy film directed by Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah. It is the third installment in the 'Bad Boys' franchise. The film follows detectives Mike Lowrey (Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Lawrence) reuniting once again when someone starts murdering people involved in an old case.
I enjoy a lot with the 'Bad Boys' movies. They're not well loved by critics, but audience viewers seem to enjoy them, and I was excited to see this one. It's not like the first two films at all and seems to settle down and take itself more seriously and I loved it even more for it.
Will Smith and Martin Lawrence don't skip a beat coming back to these characters after over 15 years on hiatus. The embodied the characters perfectly, yet still mange to show character growth from when we last seen them in 'Bad Boys II'. I was unsure going into it with the younger police officers played by Vanessa Hudgens, Alexander Ludwig and Charles Melton, but it brought something that I think was needed to the story, and all three did a great job as well.
This is my favorite film in the franchise and it's mainly because it had the most focused story. From beginning to end it knows what it wants to be, and it doesn't get jumbled in between genres as I find the other films to do. It's comedy lands when it needs to, and the action sequences are fantastic.
Overall, I know we are still in the beginning of 2020, but this film has a real chance of making my to ten favorite films of year. It's a giant adrenaline rush with lots of laughs, and some unexpected twists along the way.
5/5"
tt1502397,"I see a lot of the Negative reviews for this film seem to miss the point of a Popcorn film. Popcorn flicks are 9 times out of 10 cookie cutter scripts that serve one purpose, to let your forget your troubles for 2 hours and enjoy things being blown up or shootouts occurring that you would never see in normal day to day live."
tt1502397,"Phenomenal. I can't believe after all years they can just get back to business like that. Same characters as before just a bit of extra knowledge and experience. The best part is they maintained the same quality of Insane gangster like Johnny tapia. I probably like Johnny tapia a tad bit more but this movie was more sentimental and nostalgic. I grew up wanting to be bad boys, my best friend and I had our own bad boys verse. Even Reggie is back that's amazing"
tt1502397,"Bad boys for life is the best in the series with awesome action, great effects, hilarious comedy, great performances (especially will smith and Martin Lawrence), surprisingly well done emotional and heartfelt moments, and a good story. The only flaws are that one plot line about the villains son being will smiths son is a bit forced and leads to a pretty bad sequel bait ending. A great action flick I highly recommend."
tt1502397,"Seventeen years after Bad Boys II, Detectives Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett are back and are being Bad Boys/Men/Grandads! And they bring with them the usual mixture of explosions, chases, one-liners/immaculately choreographed deaths and friendship issues. And though both Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are both starting to/blatantly showing their age, they don't hide it, they celebrate it!"
tt1502397,Bad Boys for life. Have you seen this movie?
tt1502397,Apart from other critics & reviews I really enjoyed the movie. Both will Smith & Martin rocked the show the story was made upto their age category. We can't expect the same Script which happened 20 years before. Good action sequences with funny moments. Worth watching this movie.
tt1502397,Bad Boys for life is the third installment in the Bad Boys franchise and it has been the best one so far.
tt1502397,I laughed for two hours straight. Martin and Smith together is the best formula you can get. I did not have big expectations because of all the bad reviews here. I think this is the funniest movie this year and hope to see more movies with Martin and Smith in the future!
tt1502397,"Fun movie, flowing, the actors enjoyed doing this movie and it shows.
Great action, great laughs, perfect casting and chemistry between all actors.
Looking forward for the Bad Boy number 4, such a success requires it - bring me more!"
tt1502397,"I honestly thought before I watched this, it's probably going to either look, feel or be different in some way, or the plot would be awful, things along those lines.
So when I did watch it, I was pleasantly surprised, as it's done very much the same way as the first two.
It has the same feel, filmed the same way, which you see straight from the beginning, music is the same, plenty of wise cracks and violence and even Smith and Lawrence' chemistry still works.
The plot isn't too bad, it's not The Godfather, but you don't watch these films for an engrossing storyline, it's an action film, and that's what you get, as you did in the first two.
A very enjoyable watch, with a touch of sentimentality."
tt1502397,"We're all familiar with the Bad Boys movies, as Smith and Lawrence play two middle-age cops still stirring up trouble. There's lots of action, like car chases, explosions and lots of 'death to thine enemy'. It's really hard to explain this movie, since it's a Martin Lawrence and Will Smith movie and the second sequel in the ""Bad Boys"" theme. The movie's plot is really surprising and when you find out that the enemy in this movie is not an enemy, but....HA! I never liked the second film, but the third film is actually really good! Love the filming and the locations. The actress in this movie is really good. The first Bad Boys film gets some closure."
tt1502397,"I like them all, but for 3 I was a bit scared they would be a little to old for this. Well not just yet. But let this be the last. And we have a perfect ending. Saw it in de cinema, really great. But it's totally a different watch after the Oscars 2022 damn Will so stupid."
tt1502397,"Bad Boys for Life is a fake, soulless cash grab. Utterly blown away by this rating."
tt1502397,"Yeah, I admit it. I went to see it when I saw the trailers as part of ""Front and Center."" But, it should come as no surprise...the trailers lied."
tt1502397,I thought this would be bad. I wish they would of advertised it as a reboot. Martin lawrence my favourite bad boy is a retired 8 monrh pregnant woman with estrogen overload. Any time action happens/ fights break out the bad boys are blocked by the feminist backup team. A two hour snore fest.
tt1502397,"Oh man this new bad boys movie was better the expected. Even as 3rd movie in the series, it was great!"
tt1502397,"What a blast of a movie. How the hell can anyone rate this movie a 1 star is beyond me. With Bad Boys and a film of its nature, you just know what you are getting. Great chemistry between Will Smith and Martin Lawrence again. Excellent explosive action and slapstick comedy with cheap gags. This isn't ever going to be an Oscar winner film in the mould of The Godfather, so what are people expecting ? Fantastically set in Miami like the previous films and a brilliant storyline to boot. I thought the mixture of comedy, drama and action was spot on. The villains in the movie we're excellent and it's a 2 hour film that flowed wonderfully. You go into these sort of movies to be entertained and gripped. Well, this movie does what it says on a tin and gives the viewer the elements of an excellent action comedy. As good, if not better than the 1st 2. Highly enjoyable."
tt1502397,"One thing I must say about Michael Bay movies, they are not perfect and they have flaws, but they always have this something special, this style that makes it memorable. He has a way of presenting characters that don't have a lot of depth, but you know for sure they are Michael Bay characters. The directors of this film never managed to catch the spirits of the first two films. Bad Boys has always been a buddy movie, not some stupid family drama. The directors of Bad Boys for life did not understand the source material at its core and that's why they failed. They try to ""change"" the characters, to make them ""evolve"", but this is not the point of the franchise. The concept of Bad Boys is that they are going to stay the same, no matter how old they get."
tt1502397,"I saw the first one, on a schoolday. With a schoolmate in 1995. I went for the ride. The movie, along with the soundtrack, became a part of my transition to an adult. When the second one came out, I felt cheated, somehow.
I wanted to go for the ride. I just could not. It felt as if the second one did not grow with me."
tt1502397,"Proper crap. Don't get the hate from the last two and don't get the love for this one. Really over done it with the ""Bad boys for life"" all the way through. Cheesy acting. Bad comedy. Pretty much pathetic."
tt10919380,"This is a fun film, with a bit of slasher elements and the comedy style surrounding this genre. Now, the added value here is the great pace and the cool performance of Vince Vaughn as a teenage girl. The film is more funny than scary and there is plenty of nice dialogue and moments in there to keep you entertained. 7,5 / 10 freaky fun movie."
tt10919380,"It's a little late for a Halloween/slasher movie, but it looks like they really wanted that Friday the 13th release date. And to my surprise, this was way more fun than I thought it would be."
tt10919380,"Vince Vaughn's acting is top notch. His pancy way of running around n his girly act is what made this film entertaining.
The film starts off with a bang, lots of brutal killings n then maintains the entertaining value cos of Vaughn's top notch acting.
The film has good humor n moves at a decent pace.
The professor with the handle bar moustache looks like Edward Norton."
tt10919380,"This was a little too teen oriented for my taste, but it did have it's moments. The best were Vince Vaughn's spots following the body swap with Millie Kessler (Kathryn Newton) in which she became the Blissfield Butcher. The opening scene had some creatively gruesome murders committed by the Butcher when Vaughn still occupied his own body, the sickest was the broken wine bottle stuffed down the throat of the male teen. The tennis racket header was also kind of nasty. Once Millie/Butcher convinces her high school friends what happened as the result of an Aztec knife curse, a countdown begins to make the body exchange occur again before the result becomes permanent. Some of the murders are exceptionally violent for younger teens so I'd say discretion is advised. Not to mention an early simulated sex scene that's a bit in poor taste, but I guess I did just mention it. If I had to do it over again I'd give this movie a pass, but since I stumbled upon it thinking it would be more cleverly written, the die has already been cast."
tt10919380,"As I sat down to watch the 2020 movie titled ""Freaky"", I must admit that I wasn't really expecting the movie to be very outstanding or memorable. But still, it had Vince Vaughn in it, so chances were that it would be watchable."
tt10919380,"You can't take Freaky too seriously. If that's what you're looking for in a movie then you should just pass on this one. But if you're just looking for some easy entertainment, mindless fun and some
gory scenes then Freaky is a good option. The story has a fast pace so you never get bored, the slashing scenes are funny, inventive and well made. As for the acting it was good from the whole cast. Vince Vaughn plays a character that I would not have expected him to play, and he did it well. Freaky is a good friday night popcorn slasher comedy."
tt10919380,"A surprisingly good stab flick. It was fun and gory, with a body switching twist for that extra kick. I mean, he did make Happy Death Days and some Paranormal Activities so I'm loving his groove anyway. It looked like Vince Vaughn had a fun time filming this."
tt10919380,"This movie was a blast. It's not an academy award winning film lol. It's exactly what I was looking for, a fun Friday night. It made me laugh, had some gory kills, and the acting was good. I never understand the whole ""it's not original"" argument. Give me a break. It's a good movie."
tt10919380,"Here's a role I would never imagined Vince Vaughn doing- but damn glad he did!!! The whole body switching thing (yeah we've seen it a million times, I know) but this despite a familiar premise was sold by the two leads particularly Vaughn who seemed he was having a blast playing killer and highschool senior!"
tt10919380,"By all rights, I should hate this movie, a semi-remake of Freaky Friday that instead subverts the source material by turning it into a slasher. But you know, it ended up hitting me the right way and I was behind it pretty much all the way."
tt10919380,It's a fun body swapping horror slasher flick worth watching. Good to see Vince Vaughn make another semi relevant movie again after years of peripherality.
tt10919380,"This movie was so funny and really fun to watch, not really brutal like super scary cause this movie was comedy so not that scary, I love the comedy make me laughing from the movie was start until the movie end, but there's so many adult jokes in this film"
tt10919380,"When I saw the trailer firbthis I was cautiously optimistic that it could be ok. It looked like a Scream meets Freaky Friday. Well, it is that but it is really not very good."
tt10919380,An ancient Aztec dagger does a Freaky Friday switcheroo with high school teen Millie Kessler (Kathryn Newton) and serial killer The Butcher (Vince Vaughn). She has twenty four hours to switch back.
tt10919380,"This movie revolves around a girl that is picked on by everyone, by the fellow students, even the teachers. Then one day she swaps bodies with a serial killer. Vince Vaught truly carries this movie, Kathryn Newton does a very bad job at pretending Vince, the only thing she does is being quiet and looking like an infant who has to poop. It's the most predictable plot EVER, but the fair amount of slashing makes up for that. Then there are the demonic whispers in the movie, but that is more laughable then scary, I even dare to say there is not 1 scary thing in this movie. If you will never see this movie in your life, then you have missed out nothing, if you can't find a better movie, this one will fill your evening."
tt10919380,"I absolutely love body-swapping comedies, such as Freaky Friday and The Hot Chick. I also absolutely love horror slashers like Halloween, Friday the 13th, and Scream. To combine these different genres was a dream come true. I'm glad it's getting such positive reviews. It deserves it. Kathryn Newton was great and so fun to watch her go from a sweet shy vulnerable high school girl named Millie, to bloodthirsty serial killer. Vince Vaughn was great too. It was also fun to see him as an evil killer, turn into Millie and acting like a teenaged girl. The gore and killings were awesome and brutal."
tt10919380,"Body swap comedies have been around for decades with varied degrees of merit and success. It was both intriguing and pleasantly nostalgic to see someone trying to rework the formula in a new genre. Much like cinematic time travel, if its not thought out or properly tweaked, including that kind of plot device can be an invitation for audience nitpicking. Freaky is a throwback, there's a bare bones explanation and minus some exposition, you're expected to come along and not ask questions. This was a free spirited decision by the screenwriting team but it didn't bog me down or ruin the movie. If the movie is doing its job, you shouldn't be focusing on that and there are movies come out all the time where the explanation is ""magic?"" (Freaky Friday comes to mind but so does BIG). They do just enough to propel the story and it was silly enough to avoid too many specific questions."
tt10919380,The stage curtains open ...
tt10919380,"Borrowing generously from several genres and altogether wholly unoriginal as a result, this teen slasheresque horror gore body swap flick delivers and entertains due to two excellent performances provided by Vince Vaughn and Kathryn Newton. If you need an easy going blood splattered, daft, silly and demented pantomime to while away the time - this might just fit the bill."
tt10919380,"Freaky is a great comedy horror that's really funny and doesn't waste it's solid premise even if it's ending feels tacked on. Vince Vaughn gives an incredible performance and Kathryn Newton is great. Celeste O'Connor, Misha Osherovich and Uriah Shelton are all really good. Christopher Landon's direction is fantastic and it's well filmed. The music by Bear McCreary and the soundtrack are both excellent."
tt10919380,"I loved it. Vince knocks it out of the park as a teenage girl and all the characters really pulled off their scripts. The point of movies is to entertain and I was so entertained during this film.
The issue is you can't take this movie seriously. It is not meant to be a realistic slasher. It's just an entertaining fun teenage horror comedy and a damn good one!
Not to forget, the very talented, very beautiful and very great Kathryn Newton who made a great serial killer Barbie. Top work from her and her co stars!"
tt10919380,"""Freaky"" is one film that you might call a horror comedy parody like film still even for all of it's fun and joy it's pretty good entertainment. The story is simple as a local serial killer is on the loose known as the Butcher(in a role that Vince Vaughn hams up) killing young girls. Only something strange and different happens when he tries young and popular high school student Millie(Kathryn Newton). A change happens it's like a body switch a transformation happens between the two. The film is filled with plenty of slapstick it's like horror comedy at it's best still the blood and gore is present making a viewer feel like they are watching a classic teen slasher flick. Overall not the best type of film to be made still it's fun and tasty entertainment to dine on with the horror and comedy mix making it the ideal party feast!"
tt10919380,"I thought Vince Vaughn's perfromance was incredible! Another BlumHouse movie that turned out to be creepy and funny. Its like Jason Voorhees meets Rob's Schneiders ""Hot Chick"". It makes fun of Friday the 13th alot and other films because of it's wierd, corny killings."
tt10919380,"A brilliant and original idea for this ""slasher"" comedy, which is also a tribute to the genre. It is skillfully served by excellent acting performances by Vince Vaughn and Kathryn Newton in the leading roles, as well as the rest of the cast in supporting roles."
tt10919380,"I wasn't sure what to expect going in. Everyone, except Vince Vaughn, was an unknown to me and he has been a hit or miss over the last 15 years. The previews showed nothing but a horror comedy so the cold open being an homage to Friday the 13th while taking itself seriously and emoting genuine emotion was a great introduction to the rest of the film which didn't stray from the comedy element like the intro. The female lead played her role well but Vince Vaughn completely stole the show acting as a teenage girl. Writing that sentence feels weird but the performance never gave off an inappropriate or creepy vibe. I found myself laughing hysterically for many of his scenes and the film sent you home with unforced character development and arc for Millie and her family. There are some stereotypical characters, at some points it was an obvious commentary on old horror films but other times came off as a genuine clichÃ© instead of a satirized clichÃ©. With that said it was never distracting and didn't ruin the experience in the slightest with Vince Vaughn stealing every scene he was in."
tt7713068,It's always controversial to review a title like this. On one side we have the people who blindly defend something and on the other side we have the people who's blindly against something ....and everybody's blaming the other for giving unfair scores for different reasons.
tt7713068,"I'm glad I had my phone, the first half of the film was so boring, the second part was less boring, but still not great. Margot Robbie is good in the role, and she has some great fight scenes, the trouble is that the remainder of the film is so tedious. Good visuals, the trouble is the core of the film simply isn't there to make anything meaningful."
tt7713068,"I liked it. It was entertaining and that's what I wanted for a film.
I do get why people are whining about the ""men are bad"" agenda, but meh. Just didn't bother me in all honesty.
Plot: little loose here and there. But it was interesting and kept me entertained.
Didn't particularly like the detective character, but the others were great.
Overall I liked it."
tt7713068,"This movie has a single objective: to hate men. There's literally no other reason this movie exists. No male character is remotely good in the end, they're all backstabbing rapists and psychopaths while even the criminal women are all sympathetic to the extreme. So, fine. That's its ultimate theme, but what about how the movie tells its story? Well, let's judge it purely on that, never mind its rampant misandry. It's, um, it's terrible."
tt7713068,"Birds of Prey: and the Fantabulous Emancipation of one Harley Quinn, is a movie I had high hopes for but it fell flat. I will start off this review with the positive aspects first such as: Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn was a great casting and continues to be where I think she gives a better performance then her one in Suicide Squad, and Ewan Mcgregor plays a decent version of Black Mask. The use of colours and costumes I thought were great and I found some moments of entertainment through some of its action sequences."
tt7713068,"While Margot Robbie is a good Harley Quinn, the character was not given enough arc. The plot was predictable and mainstream, especially due to lack of a strong antagonist. The main antagonist, played by Ewan McGregor, was not developed and hence did not add significant value to the plot story. Although some of the fight scenes were entertaining, the film as a whole was truly forgettable."
tt7713068,"If you are not driven by the imperative need of understanding precisely what is happening in your movie, you might enjoy this psychedelic mix of disjointed cool visuals, great music, firecrackers, fragments of good acting...
Birds Of Prey is a mess presented in a messy way, it hardly holds together as a story but it offers moments of fun."
tt7713068,"Birds of Prey (2020) is a movie we saw in theatres shortly after it came out. The storyline focuses on Harley Quinn post Suicide Squad after she breaks up with the Joker, recovers from her depression from the breakup, and starts a new life of crime with a new crew of thieves known as Birds of Prey. A lunatic is not a fan of her work and sets out to hunt her and her crew down and bring them to their demise. This movie is directed by Cathy Yan (Dead Pigs) and stars Margot Robbie (Suicide Squad), Rosie Perez (White Men Can't Jump), Ewan McGregor (Trainspotting) and Jurnee Smollett (Lovecraft Country). The storyline for this is a huge step down from Suicide Squad and maybe the worst DC movie to date. The film tried to be cool and creative but everything from the title, storyline and premise was delivered poorly, which is too bad because the cast had potential, the writing and execution failed the potential though. Birds of Prey is a great DC storyline...but that team was created and led by Barbara Gordon, so why use that premise, remove Barbara and insert Harley Quinn, and think you'll be fine? Easy, to capitalize on the money from Suicide Squad. Unfortunately, it didnt work. I wouldn't recommend watching this and I wish DC didnt ruin this title and these characters (who are actually very good). I'd score this a 3/10 and recommend skipping it."
tt7713068,"With some great, all out performances, and a sheer sense of fun energy; Birds of Prey makes for an entertaining comic book film that may not be totally original, but is certainly different from the rest. The film's script can be a bit average at times, containing plot points you have certainly seen before, however, where Birds of Prey shines most is its unique sense of storytelling and the ridiculously entertaining things it does with it. Margot Robbie give a 'fabulous' performance as Harley Quinn, removing all my doubts of her playing the famous character after Suicide Squad. The other women in the film also give some great performances, with the greatest stand out being Mary Elizabeth Winstead who steals every ounce of her screen time, bringing her A-game as always. Ewan McGregor also gives a fun filled performance as the film's titular villain Black Mask. The film is filled with absolutely awesome action sequences that are bound to at least put a grin on your face, and if that doesn't, then the large dose of well-timed humor will certainly do the trick. In the end, Birds of Prey isn't the best DC has had to offer, but it is certainly a blast, and certainly an experience unlike any other.
My Rating: 9.25/10"
tt7713068,"Some movies decide to bring you along slowly, they setup the plot and bring you in by introducing you to the key players. Other movies kick the door open and grab you to take you along for the ride. Birds of Prey is decidedly one of the latter cases. We begin with an animated intro being narrated by Harley (Margot Robbie) where the audience is showered with cursing, violence and frenetic jokes. This was disarming for me and it helped me start laughing right off the bat. Its an odd choice to be sure but this isn't a movie that's ashamed or trying to hide what it is and I respected that choice. It also introduces the visual sensibility of the movie. It borrows from Suicide Squad but they do a good job cherry picking what worked from that movie and they leave behind the less desirable parts. The character cards are back with a couple of twists and the world is decidedly grimy and less glamorous which was a nice change of setting."
tt7713068,"Birds of Prey is another great addition to the DCEU and whilst it certainly has its flaws, I absolutely had a blast with the film"
tt7713068,Only Margot Robbie saves herself from this rubbish. I wanted to like this film and I ended up hating it. Awful.
tt7713068,"The latest DC Comics superhero movie and once again it's rather generic and forgettable in tone. The action in this one is okay but the comedy is very poor and Harley Quinn herself is best in small doses, so making her the lead character is a bizarre choice. The deliberately adult tone just means constant swearing shoehorned into the script while Ewan McGregor's bad guy is as bland as they come. It's better than GUNPOWDER MILKSHAKE thanks to a couple of halfway decent action scenes and creatively quirky moments, but the rest is merely so-so."
tt7713068,"Did you catch the 2016 DCEU disappointment SUICIDE SQUAD with Will Smith as Deadshot and Jared Leto as the Joker? Many people (myself included) thought that that film was ""just fine, nothing special"" but were impressed with the way Margot Robbie handled the Harley Quinn character and wished for a standalone film that featured the Harley Quinn character."
tt7713068,"Finally got a chance to watch Birds of Prey yesterday. I thought this movie would perform better at the box office, but sadly it isn't. Margot Robbie is an outstanding actress and I hoped the movie would have greater success for her. I'm not a huge DC fan, but still had to watch this. I enjoyed it and felt like Margot was very entertaining in her role as Harley Quinn. She was tough, funny, and was multi-dimensional. This wasn't a great film in my opinion, but an enjoyable good film that I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel to."
tt7713068,"As a ""D.C."" comics fan I see most all of the movies and this latest was a kick butt action style drama with twist and turns as it is a spotlight of bad girls at their best ""Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn delivers with action and story. Harley Quinn(Margot Robbie) has just split from her boyfriend ""The Joker"" so she has to spread her wings free and become a free girl! All of this is helped along by a cast of side characters like detective Renee Montoya, Huntress, and the sexy and beautiful black bra wearing Black Canary! However all are tied and wrapped up in a wild card subplot that involves defeating a crazy and sadistic crime lord in Roman Sionis(AKA ""Black Mask"") and underneath all of this lies the search for a diamond and teenager named Cass(Ella Jay Basco). Aside from all of this the film entertains with violence, action, bombs, and flashbacks that tell character story. Look at this as a bad ass female group as each fight crime and for their own way of life in a gleeful way The costumes are also an eye catch and the dialogue moves the film along well, so if a comic book fan open up to this picture as it's full of antiheroine glory."
tt7713068,"Funny, non stop action, kinda all over the place. Margot Robbie absolutely steals the show."
tt7713068,"{ Cassandra very "" Wisely "" chooses the laxative } ."
tt7713068,"Admittedly speaking, remember there was a time when DC Universe was bashed because most of their movies were directed by Zack Snyder who decided that style-over-substance was more pivotal to making superhero films? Then, came David Ayer with a set of the best movie trailers ever created but the outcome for the anti-hero film, Suicide Squad was at best, a mediocre motion picture."
tt7713068,I've been a fan of Harley since BTAS & thought she was the only decent thing in Suicide Squad.
tt7713068,"In Gotham City, the Joker breaks up with Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) and without his protection, several criminals that have a beef with her hunt her down. When the teenager Cassandra Cain (Ella Jay Basco) pickpockets a diamond that has the account numbers of a fortune from the gangster Victor Zsasz (Chris Messina), who is the right-hand of the powerful criminal Roman Sionis (Ewan McGregor), he put a contract on her. Harley Quinn, Police Detective Renee Montoya (Rosie Perez), Helena ""The Huntress"" Bertinelli (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and Dinah ""Black Canary"" Lance (Jurnee Smollett-Bell) team up to protect Cassandra."
tt7713068,"Continues a wining-ish streak for DC with a pretty solid film that is at the very least WAY better than Suicide Squad. It's messy as hell, at times crassly mean-spirited, and mostly not that funny, but for the most part it's still a great deal of fun. Harley is still a fun character, and this version of her that is more than just an oversexualized girlfriend of the Joker is a much more interesting character to follow. Her girl gang and resentful breakup is also just a very human story. Yeah it was done better in the animated series currently on DC Universe, but still, this one is fun. The other Birds are pretty good, especially Huntress, but this really is Harley's show, and she's good. I do have to give love to Ewan McGregor as Black Mask. Yeah he's done villains before, but good god, this is one helluva villain. I love the character Black Mask, and he absolutely nails the character. Charming, funny, completely psychotic, I was a happy geek watching him on screen. Not to mention McGregor is clearly having a ball in the roll, and that energy does pass on to you. Overall though Birds of Prey is a mess. It's plot is basically Snatch but not as good, and it's attitude is aggressive, but god damn does it ever have an attitude. It has an identity, a style, and a look I can't deny, and I will admit it was pretty fun. It's got some solid performances, characters I wanted to see, and a solid style. It's a wild swing, and while it doesn't totally nail it, I admire it's ambition."
tt7713068,"I'll just go straight for it, if you're going to downvote this review for defending a genuinely entertaining violent film, i get that. Literally just WATCH THE MOVIE! This movie is anything but a ""men are trash"" movie. It's a fun flick about a heist where it's all knives at eachothers throats. Genuinely formulaic at times, sure, but that's practically a given for these types of films! Margot Robbie gave a fantastic performance as the Quinn herself, and the side characters had their moments as well! Gotta give a FAT shoutout to McGregor for his role. He brought just as much flame and fire as Margot gave her role. Go ahead and do yourself a favor. This is a good ass time to watch!"
tt7713068,Margot Robbie is the perfect Harley Quinn. Over all BOP was super fun. Great action and great music. Rosie Perez is meh at best. Ewan kills it per usual. I love that they made an R rated comic book film. DC has the balls to do it knowing it won't make as much $$$ which is probably why this is one of the better comic movies to come out in a while. 7/10ð¤
tt7713068,"I was captured to watch this in part from the DVD cover, and in part from the potential in the story. It started out as an introductory flat 2-D cheap Saturday morning cartoon intro to our main character. That was pretty snoozy but I kept waiting and waiting and ... until I noticed my brain alertness level was somewhere between watching grass grow & deep sleep.
Summation:
1. Movie is suppose to be a superhero team spoof, but so shallow flat I actually ended up not caring - just waiting for it to end.
2. 50% of screen time is like a fashion show catwalk of Robbie & her sometimes being cute by staring at the camera; just dumb & boring. Another 25% was showcasing how non-conforming her character could be which did not come across as real - actually it was comic book real.
3. Action scenes were 90% very poorly executed flying kicks & arm takedowns that a 10 year old could perform better.
4. Both dialogue & music lyrics were heavy on the obscenities; a cheap way to fake toughness.
5. Only positive, about 30 seconds worth, was Jurnee Smollett-Bell's singing a classic song."
tt7713068,"Is it my imagination or does this film, like so many others these days, seem to have a dislike of men?"
tt7713068,GRADE: C-
tt7713068,"I super LOVED this movie! Everything was awesome and better than I could have hoped for. Margot Robbie gave a complex portrayal. Huntress, Black Canary, Montoya were all super great! This is one of the best super hero movies ever! Also that egg sandwich and Captain Boomerang!"
tt7713068,Greetings from Lithuania.
tt7713068,"Not impressed with this film. The novelty of Harley Quinn runs out quickly, the story is terrible, it's not interesting and kind of boring. Also Ewan McGregor makes a terrible villain. One of the worst. Fail."
tt7713068,"It doesn't get too much worse than this disjointed hate-mess. Everyone gets murdered or physically damaged big- time, except those people who deserve it most...the movie makers. If this is DC Comic book fodder then let's call it what it is Denigrating Crap. As an exercise in morose verbosity, it's on top of the trash pile, as entertainment, it's on the lowest rung. Made by, and marketed for destructive Air Heads - this could only please the foulest of feeble minds - those that fester by feeding from the dung heaps of this sorry world."
tt7713068,"This film start with Harley Quinn narrate about she broke up with Joker, and everyone want her dead, including a crime lord ""Roman"" scene! As turnout, this film is about Harley Quinn need to protect a girl ""Cassandra"" from Roman, because Cassandra accidentally stole Roman's ring and swallow it! Entire film full of annoying narration voice and flashback scene of Harley Quinn! Make the film unwatchable! Barely laughable scene is, The Huntress want to say her name, but the people keep mocking her name! The action in the film also quite messy, not intense and full of overuse slow motion scene! The action have shooting scene, martial art fighting scene, hitting with baseball bat scene, and stabbing scene! All the action scene barely watchable, because it not enough bloody violence scene! Such as, Harley Quinn shooting at the police station scene! She shooting confetti instead of real bullet! LMFAO! At the end, Harley Quinn and Cassandra kill Roman by a grenade! Harley Quinn's sidekicks setup a gang called ""Birds Of Prey""! Still have one post credit narration scene from Harley Quinn! She mocking the audience still stay put and talking a secret about Batman! That's it! Another disappointed blockbuster film!"
tt7713068,Start to finish this movie did exactly what we needed it to do be amazing and it did I don't know what's with the bad reviews but this flick was a powerhouse of action comedy and plain old fun
tt7713068,She plays her tricks but she is bad at it.
tt7713068,"It's a comic book movie based around a female. In comics, most of the villains are men. So, yeah, she creatively beats men. Fans of hers know she's not Wonder Woman. Relax, enjoy a fun movie. Not sure if it was the marketing or the long title, but more people should've seen this. Hope second week is better than first. I see why it's rated R. Many tends won't legally see it."
tt7713068,"Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of one Harley Quinn is a fantastic Warner Bros. DC R-rated movie since Suicide Squad, and Joaquin Phoenix's Joker. It's absolutely everything you ever wanted from Deadpool himself. It's funny, action packed, dazzling, massive thrill ride, and masterpiece, and colorful explosive DC Extravaganza! Margot Robbie has done it again as Harley Quinn! And Ewan McGregor is not so bad as the Black Mask, one of the best supervillain of Batman Universe. This reminds me of one of the best DC's #1 hit from DC Universe... Harley Quinn. And the story is kind of like the R-rated show. Now this is the R-rated film you wanted to see."
tt7713068,"Birds of prey shows that DC has finally righted the ship after several early stumbles in this franchise. By focusing on smaller, more personal stories with more personal stakes. Birds of prey is a very entertaining movie, albeit one with some irritating flaws."
tt7713068,"An absolute riot from start to finish, Birds Of Prey is by far the best film in DC's Extended Universe, thrilling with delirious eccentricity and fun-loving action throughout. Bolstered by a dynamite lead cast, striking and energetic direction and gorgeous visuals, it's an enormously entertaining blockbuster."
tt7713068,"I found ""Suicide Squad"" to be wasted potential with a cool gallery of characters but who were not used to do much interesting. I expected this one to be even worse but I was actually surprised: it's better!"
tt7713068,"This one is good,probably best in DC universe of late.
I was pleasantly surprised by this film it's funny it's quirky.
it has all that to be a very entertaining ride."
tt7713068,"Is this a good movie? Not really. Is it a bad movie? Not at all. This is not a 10, but certainly nowhere near a 1. Don't get distracted by everyone saying that's it's a bad film. Go form your own opinion!
Like someone in these comment said, too bad some reviewers have a political agenda to push on this film accusing it of ""man hating"". It's a comic book movie based around a female. In comics, most of the villains are men... so, yeah, I don't know what people were expecting, but she has to beat man!"
tt7713068,"Good movie. Not the best in the dceu, but not bad. DC has been on the right track since Aquaman. I loved the very cartoonish feel the movie had. Never took itself too seriously. Lots of humor and a decent plot. Fun action scenes and the movie was very fast paced. The way the story is told is definitely inspired by Deadpool, which works in some cases, and doesn't in others. Liked the villains, especially Victor. Cool to seem him on the big screen. Liked how it left Joker out (though I'm a huge fan of him). Hate pop music but the pop heavy soundtrack was actually very good. Cool to see a movie with all those badass woman, but without the overly feminist feel. Overall a good movie but not amazing. The hyena could have been in the movie a bit more."
tt7713068,"The plot is so simple that everything that happens, happens for the sake of the plot."
tt7713068,"I don't get the negative reviews at all ! great movie with really beautiful john wick type action sequences but not as over the top as john wick. i'm a guy and i LOVED this film. my only complaint is that there isn't a lot of black mask in the film but it's not a dealbreaker. Lately, we've gotten the ""agenda"" pushed heavily onto us, in some cases (captain marvel) it's been forced and BOP is obviously in the same lane but it is done so tastefully and masterfully. margot robbie is a phenomenal actress, she absolutely nails the part and so do all the other beautiful women in this film. do yourself a favor and watch it, it's got great humor that isn't forced and really top notch action sequences."
tt7713068,Have you ever watched a game where the team that won didn't play very well but they won due to one player being outstanding and pretty much just putting his teammates on his back and carrying them to victory?
tt7713068,"Birds of pray is so much fun! You Harley is out there kicking ass like crazy, I feel like it corrected a lot of things that suicide squad failed to do!
Had so many great fight scenes and was a lot of fun!
I knew it had a MA rating but didn't think it would live up to it! But it did had some really full on scenes.
Hopefully dc can see that this is the way and will push for a less kid friendly Audience, all the birds of prey cast where really good didn't hate any of them, Ewan McGregor stands out as the woman hating mask loving germ he is! What they do with him is the only thing that makes me alittle upset but he was amazing in this film as the rest of the cast! Big shout out to Mary Elizabeth winstead! Loved huntress a lot would love to see a lot more of her!!"
tt7713068,A really weak choppy movie with a few (very few) nice action scenes. The last fight excepted. So badly staged.
tt7713068,"Started slow and then picked up steam. Then it got exciting. Funny film to watch and Harley didn't disappoint. Along with her supporting of heroines like the Canary, Huntress and The cop. Fight scenes were also very entertaining and well Choreographed. Despite any negative reviews, this one was worth the time and I am very critical of films."
tt7713068,"The Joker(Leto, not Phoenix) kicks out Harley(Robbie, showing more sides and dimension), in just the most recent of many cases of her trying to please guys who clearly aren't good for her. As such she no longer has his protection, and as it turns out a lot of people have grievances with her. They are frequently introduced in freeze-frame gags that are one of the numerous ways in which this is Suicide Squad if that movie was actually great, and not a mess, editing and tone wise. Other examples include the extensive use of music, which here is allowed to land and be effective, instead of almost immediately ending. As well as the story structure not being quite chronological in showing the events, now properly setting up who the different people are, and giving them depth. Black Canary(Smollett-Bell, an incredible performer, you seriously have to hear her cover of ""This Is A Man's World"" for yourself) sings in the club of Roman Sionis(McGregor, deliciously unpredictable as a cruel narcissist), but if pressed, she might be willing to admit that he does awful things. Renee Montoya(Perez) is an excellent cop who struggles to because of rotten coworkers. She believes that Huntress(Elizabeth Winstead, cool while also a hilarious Batman parody) is working for him, just like Victor Zsasz(Messina, sadistic, understands his master and knows how to deal with his outbursts) his right-hand man. Teenager Cassandra Cain just robbed him, not realising it would put a bullseye on her back. So the four women(who feel like they're each in their own film... and it's so good. Just. The very best) have to try to protect her, as every criminal in Gotham City tries to score by catching her."
tt7713068,"It's been 2 weeks and I'm still not fully sure how I feel about this film. On one hand, the film has incredible stunt and fight choreography, with most of the action being in-camera. However, aside from Harley Quinn, I never found myself on board with any of the characters and in some instances, was annoyed by them. I think there's a good film somewhere in here, but everything starts with a good script. And Birds of Prey definitely didn't have that."
tt7713068,"I got a weird impression from the trailer and kind of went in thinking I wouldn't like it, I don't know why I ever even doubted that I would love Harley! Maybe it's because I went in with low expectations, but I loved it!"
tt7713068,"After an animated backstory of Dr. Harleen Quinzel's journey to becoming Harley Quinn (narrated by the film's star, Margot Robbie, who provides voice-over throughout the film), she breaks up with the Joker as only Harley can: Ace Chemicals go BOOM. Not having thought this through, Harley finds she has no shortage of scumbags gunning for her who were only held at bay by her connection with Mr. J."
tt7713068,This low ratting is a bunch of bull. Because it's my favorite DC movie in awhile I love Black Mask crewing so much scenery he looks like he is about to eat the set and Harley as the narrator keeps the film from getting to dark. It does something feel like a Harley Quinn movie more than a Birds of Prey movie but they balance it out to be about 60 40
tt7713068,I dont understand why so hate? i like it more than suicide squad for real
tt7713068,"I loved Birds of Prey. It is Fantabulous ð It is brash, colourful, violent, silly, comic, and at the same time has pathos and is emancipating. Those women kick some serious arse! The music is fantastic. Let the whole thing wash over you and emerge grinning into the light. 10/10!"
tt7713068,It was so good I clapped at the end it's different funny the style of it is amazing so much better than suicide squad
tt7713068,"Birds Of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn) is a superhero film based on the DC Comics team of the same name and a sequel/spin-off to 2016's Suicide Squad. Starring Margot Robbie in the lead role as Harley Quinn, it is a fast-paced, violent, and sometimes disjointed follow-up with varying degrees of entertainment value."
tt7713068,"Simply awful.
From the acting, to the script, to the direction."
tt7713068,"I don't feel like this was some crazy man hating movie, or whatever you all are saying."
tt7713068,"Wasn't sure I wanted to watch this but I must say I'm glad I did, Margot Robbie is great as Harley Quinn as she was in the Suicide Squad and the other characters are also good. Not much of a storyline but a harmless fun film, give it a go"
tt7713068,"Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn is as ridiculous as it sounds, but Harley Quinn is quite the ridiculous character herself. For the most part, the DC Extended Universe has been largely hit or miss. Since its inception, it has always felt like an on-the-whim pop culture reaction to get on board with the way that other studios are heading. The DCEU has never felt like it simmered in long-term development and planning to create one cohesive ""extended universe"" across multiple films. That is one of the many reasons why, with eight films under its belt, it has not been met with critical success and box office records like the far more visionary and cohesive MCU. The once area where Warner/DC succeeded is in casting. Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman, Henry Cavill as Superman, and, yes, Margot Robbie as one Harley Quinn."
tt7713068,"After Suicide Squad split DC fans down the middle, one might've assumed that Harley Quinn's story in the DCEU was over. It wasn't."
tt7713068,Saw this with my 16 and 17 year old daughters who should be prime audience for this. They both pronounced it the worst superhero film they have ever seen.
tt7713068,The only good thing about this film is the existence and appearance of Harley Quinn herself or else the story is stupid + illogical and the other characters are also lame - Nothing great.
tt7713068,"""More women need to be nominated for awards"" Then stop coming up with garbage!"
tt7713068,"I thought that this was going to be Suicide Squad II but it turns out that it happens to be completely different. The main reason I thought that was because it was clear that Harley Quinn was the main character. Well, that is certainly true, but I also thought that she was also a member of the Birds of Prey, which happens to be another group of super heroes. Well, that turns out not to be the case either, which certainly shows you how much I know about the superhero worlds beyond what I see in the films."
tt7713068,"There is a ""car chase"" at about 25mph, a fight in a bouncy castle baseball bats v guns/knives. Disjointed narrative, McGregor is about as intimidating as cornflakes. It doesn't know who it's audience is. Mercifully short."
tt7713068,"Since skipping from seeing it at the cinema after finding Suicide Squad (2016-also reviewed) to be an utter mess, I've found The Suicide Squad (2020-also reviewed) and the Harleen graphic novel written and drawn by Stjepan Sejic to both be superb, I've been curious about catching up with this movie. Happily surprised to get this from my dad as a Christmas present, I got ready to see the birds fly."
tt7713068,Birds of Prey
tt7713068,"Perfectly executed IMAX thrill ride! A blast of exciting action, cinematography is beautiful, comedy is spot on, colors were so nice, and the stunts oh boy unbelievably well done. I'm so happy with the amount of character development involved a lot of movies don't heave enough of it Birds of Prey had plenty of letting the audience know as much info needed. I love the way everything plays out with so much style; very satisfying experience early into the year. Also my 790th review which is great!!"
tt7713068,"This movie failed on every level for me. The action scenes were somewhat decent, but the editing is on par with Suicide Squad at times. The story is told out of order, which would work if it had an interesting one. The portrayal of the characters was somewhat adequate, but the focus on Harley just showed how insecure this chick is about her career.
I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone with reasonable standards."
tt7713068,DONT LISTEN TO THOSE BAD REVIEWS. JUST WATCH IT. It's definitely worth to watch.
tt7713068,"Firstly, if you haven't seen this yet, but partied your way through the first ""Kick Arse"" movie, watch this ASAP."
tt7713068,"I really did enjoy this movie, it had a lot of heart and it was sincerely funny. The best performances were given by Margot Robbie and Ewan McGregor both seemed to genuinely encapsulate the idea of their character or rather the direction in which their characters were taken. Don't listen to the detractors. Go and see the film for yourself and make up your own mind on whether or not you like the film."
MovieId,UserReviews
tt7713068,It's always controversial to review a title like this. On one side we have the people who blindly defend something and on the other side we have the people who's blindly against something ....and everybody's blaming the other for giving unfair scores for different reasons.
tt7713068,"I'm glad I had my phone, the first half of the film was so boring, the second part was less boring, but still not great. Margot Robbie is good in the role, and she has some great fight scenes, the trouble is that the remainder of the film is so tedious. Good visuals, the trouble is the core of the film simply isn't there to make anything meaningful."
tt7713068,"I liked it. It was entertaining and that's what I wanted for a film.
I do get why people are whining about the ""men are bad"" agenda, but meh. Just didn't bother me in all honesty.
Plot: little loose here and there. But it was interesting and kept me entertained.
Didn't particularly like the detective character, but the others were great.
Overall I liked it."
tt7713068,"This movie has a single objective: to hate men. There's literally no other reason this movie exists. No male character is remotely good in the end, they're all backstabbing rapists and psychopaths while even the criminal women are all sympathetic to the extreme. So, fine. That's its ultimate theme, but what about how the movie tells its story? Well, let's judge it purely on that, never mind its rampant misandry. It's, um, it's terrible."
tt7713068,"Birds of Prey: and the Fantabulous Emancipation of one Harley Quinn, is a movie I had high hopes for but it fell flat. I will start off this review with the positive aspects first such as: Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn was a great casting and continues to be where I think she gives a better performance then her one in Suicide Squad, and Ewan Mcgregor plays a decent version of Black Mask. The use of colours and costumes I thought were great and I found some moments of entertainment through some of its action sequences."
tt7713068,"While Margot Robbie is a good Harley Quinn, the character was not given enough arc. The plot was predictable and mainstream, especially due to lack of a strong antagonist. The main antagonist, played by Ewan McGregor, was not developed and hence did not add significant value to the plot story. Although some of the fight scenes were entertaining, the film as a whole was truly forgettable."
tt7713068,"If you are not driven by the imperative need of understanding precisely what is happening in your movie, you might enjoy this psychedelic mix of disjointed cool visuals, great music, firecrackers, fragments of good acting...
Birds Of Prey is a mess presented in a messy way, it hardly holds together as a story but it offers moments of fun."
tt7713068,"Birds of Prey (2020) is a movie we saw in theatres shortly after it came out. The storyline focuses on Harley Quinn post Suicide Squad after she breaks up with the Joker, recovers from her depression from the breakup, and starts a new life of crime with a new crew of thieves known as Birds of Prey. A lunatic is not a fan of her work and sets out to hunt her and her crew down and bring them to their demise. This movie is directed by Cathy Yan (Dead Pigs) and stars Margot Robbie (Suicide Squad), Rosie Perez (White Men Can't Jump), Ewan McGregor (Trainspotting) and Jurnee Smollett (Lovecraft Country). The storyline for this is a huge step down from Suicide Squad and maybe the worst DC movie to date. The film tried to be cool and creative but everything from the title, storyline and premise was delivered poorly, which is too bad because the cast had potential, the writing and execution failed the potential though. Birds of Prey is a great DC storyline...but that team was created and led by Barbara Gordon, so why use that premise, remove Barbara and insert Harley Quinn, and think you'll be fine? Easy, to capitalize on the money from Suicide Squad. Unfortunately, it didnt work. I wouldn't recommend watching this and I wish DC didnt ruin this title and these characters (who are actually very good). I'd score this a 3/10 and recommend skipping it."
tt7713068,"With some great, all out performances, and a sheer sense of fun energy; Birds of Prey makes for an entertaining comic book film that may not be totally original, but is certainly different from the rest. The film's script can be a bit average at times, containing plot points you have certainly seen before, however, where Birds of Prey shines most is its unique sense of storytelling and the ridiculously entertaining things it does with it. Margot Robbie give a 'fabulous' performance as Harley Quinn, removing all my doubts of her playing the famous character after Suicide Squad. The other women in the film also give some great performances, with the greatest stand out being Mary Elizabeth Winstead who steals every ounce of her screen time, bringing her A-game as always. Ewan McGregor also gives a fun filled performance as the film's titular villain Black Mask. The film is filled with absolutely awesome action sequences that are bound to at least put a grin on your face, and if that doesn't, then the large dose of well-timed humor will certainly do the trick. In the end, Birds of Prey isn't the best DC has had to offer, but it is certainly a blast, and certainly an experience unlike any other.
My Rating: 9.25/10"
tt7713068,"Some movies decide to bring you along slowly, they setup the plot and bring you in by introducing you to the key players. Other movies kick the door open and grab you to take you along for the ride. Birds of Prey is decidedly one of the latter cases. We begin with an animated intro being narrated by Harley (Margot Robbie) where the audience is showered with cursing, violence and frenetic jokes. This was disarming for me and it helped me start laughing right off the bat. Its an odd choice to be sure but this isn't a movie that's ashamed or trying to hide what it is and I respected that choice. It also introduces the visual sensibility of the movie. It borrows from Suicide Squad but they do a good job cherry picking what worked from that movie and they leave behind the less desirable parts. The character cards are back with a couple of twists and the world is decidedly grimy and less glamorous which was a nice change of setting."
tt7713068,"Birds of Prey is another great addition to the DCEU and whilst it certainly has its flaws, I absolutely had a blast with the film"
tt7713068,Only Margot Robbie saves herself from this rubbish. I wanted to like this film and I ended up hating it. Awful.
tt7713068,"The latest DC Comics superhero movie and once again it's rather generic and forgettable in tone. The action in this one is okay but the comedy is very poor and Harley Quinn herself is best in small doses, so making her the lead character is a bizarre choice. The deliberately adult tone just means constant swearing shoehorned into the script while Ewan McGregor's bad guy is as bland as they come. It's better than GUNPOWDER MILKSHAKE thanks to a couple of halfway decent action scenes and creatively quirky moments, but the rest is merely so-so."
tt7713068,"Did you catch the 2016 DCEU disappointment SUICIDE SQUAD with Will Smith as Deadshot and Jared Leto as the Joker? Many people (myself included) thought that that film was ""just fine, nothing special"" but were impressed with the way Margot Robbie handled the Harley Quinn character and wished for a standalone film that featured the Harley Quinn character."
tt7713068,"Finally got a chance to watch Birds of Prey yesterday. I thought this movie would perform better at the box office, but sadly it isn't. Margot Robbie is an outstanding actress and I hoped the movie would have greater success for her. I'm not a huge DC fan, but still had to watch this. I enjoyed it and felt like Margot was very entertaining in her role as Harley Quinn. She was tough, funny, and was multi-dimensional. This wasn't a great film in my opinion, but an enjoyable good film that I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel to."
tt7713068,"As a ""D.C."" comics fan I see most all of the movies and this latest was a kick butt action style drama with twist and turns as it is a spotlight of bad girls at their best ""Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn delivers with action and story. Harley Quinn(Margot Robbie) has just split from her boyfriend ""The Joker"" so she has to spread her wings free and become a free girl! All of this is helped along by a cast of side characters like detective Renee Montoya, Huntress, and the sexy and beautiful black bra wearing Black Canary! However all are tied and wrapped up in a wild card subplot that involves defeating a crazy and sadistic crime lord in Roman Sionis(AKA ""Black Mask"") and underneath all of this lies the search for a diamond and teenager named Cass(Ella Jay Basco). Aside from all of this the film entertains with violence, action, bombs, and flashbacks that tell character story. Look at this as a bad ass female group as each fight crime and for their own way of life in a gleeful way The costumes are also an eye catch and the dialogue moves the film along well, so if a comic book fan open up to this picture as it's full of antiheroine glory."
tt7713068,"Funny, non stop action, kinda all over the place. Margot Robbie absolutely steals the show."
tt7713068,"{ Cassandra very "" Wisely "" chooses the laxative } ."
tt7713068,"Admittedly speaking, remember there was a time when DC Universe was bashed because most of their movies were directed by Zack Snyder who decided that style-over-substance was more pivotal to making superhero films? Then, came David Ayer with a set of the best movie trailers ever created but the outcome for the anti-hero film, Suicide Squad was at best, a mediocre motion picture."
tt7713068,I've been a fan of Harley since BTAS & thought she was the only decent thing in Suicide Squad.
tt7713068,"In Gotham City, the Joker breaks up with Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) and without his protection, several criminals that have a beef with her hunt her down. When the teenager Cassandra Cain (Ella Jay Basco) pickpockets a diamond that has the account numbers of a fortune from the gangster Victor Zsasz (Chris Messina), who is the right-hand of the powerful criminal Roman Sionis (Ewan McGregor), he put a contract on her. Harley Quinn, Police Detective Renee Montoya (Rosie Perez), Helena ""The Huntress"" Bertinelli (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and Dinah ""Black Canary"" Lance (Jurnee Smollett-Bell) team up to protect Cassandra."
tt7713068,"Continues a wining-ish streak for DC with a pretty solid film that is at the very least WAY better than Suicide Squad. It's messy as hell, at times crassly mean-spirited, and mostly not that funny, but for the most part it's still a great deal of fun. Harley is still a fun character, and this version of her that is more than just an oversexualized girlfriend of the Joker is a much more interesting character to follow. Her girl gang and resentful breakup is also just a very human story. Yeah it was done better in the animated series currently on DC Universe, but still, this one is fun. The other Birds are pretty good, especially Huntress, but this really is Harley's show, and she's good. I do have to give love to Ewan McGregor as Black Mask. Yeah he's done villains before, but good god, this is one helluva villain. I love the character Black Mask, and he absolutely nails the character. Charming, funny, completely psychotic, I was a happy geek watching him on screen. Not to mention McGregor is clearly having a ball in the roll, and that energy does pass on to you. Overall though Birds of Prey is a mess. It's plot is basically Snatch but not as good, and it's attitude is aggressive, but god damn does it ever have an attitude. It has an identity, a style, and a look I can't deny, and I will admit it was pretty fun. It's got some solid performances, characters I wanted to see, and a solid style. It's a wild swing, and while it doesn't totally nail it, I admire it's ambition."
tt7713068,"I'll just go straight for it, if you're going to downvote this review for defending a genuinely entertaining violent film, i get that. Literally just WATCH THE MOVIE! This movie is anything but a ""men are trash"" movie. It's a fun flick about a heist where it's all knives at eachothers throats. Genuinely formulaic at times, sure, but that's practically a given for these types of films! Margot Robbie gave a fantastic performance as the Quinn herself, and the side characters had their moments as well! Gotta give a FAT shoutout to McGregor for his role. He brought just as much flame and fire as Margot gave her role. Go ahead and do yourself a favor. This is a good ass time to watch!"
tt7713068,Margot Robbie is the perfect Harley Quinn. Over all BOP was super fun. Great action and great music. Rosie Perez is meh at best. Ewan kills it per usual. I love that they made an R rated comic book film. DC has the balls to do it knowing it won't make as much $$$ which is probably why this is one of the better comic movies to come out in a while. 7/10ð¤
tt7713068,"I was captured to watch this in part from the DVD cover, and in part from the potential in the story. It started out as an introductory flat 2-D cheap Saturday morning cartoon intro to our main character. That was pretty snoozy but I kept waiting and waiting and ... until I noticed my brain alertness level was somewhere between watching grass grow & deep sleep.
Summation:
1. Movie is suppose to be a superhero team spoof, but so shallow flat I actually ended up not caring - just waiting for it to end.
2. 50% of screen time is like a fashion show catwalk of Robbie & her sometimes being cute by staring at the camera; just dumb & boring. Another 25% was showcasing how non-conforming her character could be which did not come across as real - actually it was comic book real.
3. Action scenes were 90% very poorly executed flying kicks & arm takedowns that a 10 year old could perform better.
4. Both dialogue & music lyrics were heavy on the obscenities; a cheap way to fake toughness.
5. Only positive, about 30 seconds worth, was Jurnee Smollett-Bell's singing a classic song."
tt7713068,"Is it my imagination or does this film, like so many others these days, seem to have a dislike of men?"
tt7713068,GRADE: C-
tt7713068,"I super LOVED this movie! Everything was awesome and better than I could have hoped for. Margot Robbie gave a complex portrayal. Huntress, Black Canary, Montoya were all super great! This is one of the best super hero movies ever! Also that egg sandwich and Captain Boomerang!"
tt7713068,Greetings from Lithuania.
tt7713068,"Not impressed with this film. The novelty of Harley Quinn runs out quickly, the story is terrible, it's not interesting and kind of boring. Also Ewan McGregor makes a terrible villain. One of the worst. Fail."
tt7713068,"It doesn't get too much worse than this disjointed hate-mess. Everyone gets murdered or physically damaged big- time, except those people who deserve it most...the movie makers. If this is DC Comic book fodder then let's call it what it is Denigrating Crap. As an exercise in morose verbosity, it's on top of the trash pile, as entertainment, it's on the lowest rung. Made by, and marketed for destructive Air Heads - this could only please the foulest of feeble minds - those that fester by feeding from the dung heaps of this sorry world."
tt7713068,"This film start with Harley Quinn narrate about she broke up with Joker, and everyone want her dead, including a crime lord ""Roman"" scene! As turnout, this film is about Harley Quinn need to protect a girl ""Cassandra"" from Roman, because Cassandra accidentally stole Roman's ring and swallow it! Entire film full of annoying narration voice and flashback scene of Harley Quinn! Make the film unwatchable! Barely laughable scene is, The Huntress want to say her name, but the people keep mocking her name! The action in the film also quite messy, not intense and full of overuse slow motion scene! The action have shooting scene, martial art fighting scene, hitting with baseball bat scene, and stabbing scene! All the action scene barely watchable, because it not enough bloody violence scene! Such as, Harley Quinn shooting at the police station scene! She shooting confetti instead of real bullet! LMFAO! At the end, Harley Quinn and Cassandra kill Roman by a grenade! Harley Quinn's sidekicks setup a gang called ""Birds Of Prey""! Still have one post credit narration scene from Harley Quinn! She mocking the audience still stay put and talking a secret about Batman! That's it! Another disappointed blockbuster film!"
tt7713068,Start to finish this movie did exactly what we needed it to do be amazing and it did I don't know what's with the bad reviews but this flick was a powerhouse of action comedy and plain old fun
tt7713068,She plays her tricks but she is bad at it.
tt7713068,"It's a comic book movie based around a female. In comics, most of the villains are men. So, yeah, she creatively beats men. Fans of hers know she's not Wonder Woman. Relax, enjoy a fun movie. Not sure if it was the marketing or the long title, but more people should've seen this. Hope second week is better than first. I see why it's rated R. Many tends won't legally see it."
tt7713068,"Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of one Harley Quinn is a fantastic Warner Bros. DC R-rated movie since Suicide Squad, and Joaquin Phoenix's Joker. It's absolutely everything you ever wanted from Deadpool himself. It's funny, action packed, dazzling, massive thrill ride, and masterpiece, and colorful explosive DC Extravaganza! Margot Robbie has done it again as Harley Quinn! And Ewan McGregor is not so bad as the Black Mask, one of the best supervillain of Batman Universe. This reminds me of one of the best DC's #1 hit from DC Universe... Harley Quinn. And the story is kind of like the R-rated show. Now this is the R-rated film you wanted to see."
tt7713068,"Birds of prey shows that DC has finally righted the ship after several early stumbles in this franchise. By focusing on smaller, more personal stories with more personal stakes. Birds of prey is a very entertaining movie, albeit one with some irritating flaws."
tt7713068,"An absolute riot from start to finish, Birds Of Prey is by far the best film in DC's Extended Universe, thrilling with delirious eccentricity and fun-loving action throughout. Bolstered by a dynamite lead cast, striking and energetic direction and gorgeous visuals, it's an enormously entertaining blockbuster."
tt7713068,"I found ""Suicide Squad"" to be wasted potential with a cool gallery of characters but who were not used to do much interesting. I expected this one to be even worse but I was actually surprised: it's better!"
tt7713068,"This one is good,probably best in DC universe of late.
I was pleasantly surprised by this film it's funny it's quirky.
it has all that to be a very entertaining ride."
tt7713068,"Is this a good movie? Not really. Is it a bad movie? Not at all. This is not a 10, but certainly nowhere near a 1. Don't get distracted by everyone saying that's it's a bad film. Go form your own opinion!
Like someone in these comment said, too bad some reviewers have a political agenda to push on this film accusing it of ""man hating"". It's a comic book movie based around a female. In comics, most of the villains are men... so, yeah, I don't know what people were expecting, but she has to beat man!"
tt7713068,"Good movie. Not the best in the dceu, but not bad. DC has been on the right track since Aquaman. I loved the very cartoonish feel the movie had. Never took itself too seriously. Lots of humor and a decent plot. Fun action scenes and the movie was very fast paced. The way the story is told is definitely inspired by Deadpool, which works in some cases, and doesn't in others. Liked the villains, especially Victor. Cool to seem him on the big screen. Liked how it left Joker out (though I'm a huge fan of him). Hate pop music but the pop heavy soundtrack was actually very good. Cool to see a movie with all those badass woman, but without the overly feminist feel. Overall a good movie but not amazing. The hyena could have been in the movie a bit more."
tt7713068,"The plot is so simple that everything that happens, happens for the sake of the plot."
tt7713068,"I don't get the negative reviews at all ! great movie with really beautiful john wick type action sequences but not as over the top as john wick. i'm a guy and i LOVED this film. my only complaint is that there isn't a lot of black mask in the film but it's not a dealbreaker. Lately, we've gotten the ""agenda"" pushed heavily onto us, in some cases (captain marvel) it's been forced and BOP is obviously in the same lane but it is done so tastefully and masterfully. margot robbie is a phenomenal actress, she absolutely nails the part and so do all the other beautiful women in this film. do yourself a favor and watch it, it's got great humor that isn't forced and really top notch action sequences."
tt7713068,Have you ever watched a game where the team that won didn't play very well but they won due to one player being outstanding and pretty much just putting his teammates on his back and carrying them to victory?
tt7713068,"Birds of pray is so much fun! You Harley is out there kicking ass like crazy, I feel like it corrected a lot of things that suicide squad failed to do!
Had so many great fight scenes and was a lot of fun!
I knew it had a MA rating but didn't think it would live up to it! But it did had some really full on scenes.
Hopefully dc can see that this is the way and will push for a less kid friendly Audience, all the birds of prey cast where really good didn't hate any of them, Ewan McGregor stands out as the woman hating mask loving germ he is! What they do with him is the only thing that makes me alittle upset but he was amazing in this film as the rest of the cast! Big shout out to Mary Elizabeth winstead! Loved huntress a lot would love to see a lot more of her!!"
tt7713068,A really weak choppy movie with a few (very few) nice action scenes. The last fight excepted. So badly staged.
tt7713068,"Started slow and then picked up steam. Then it got exciting. Funny film to watch and Harley didn't disappoint. Along with her supporting of heroines like the Canary, Huntress and The cop. Fight scenes were also very entertaining and well Choreographed. Despite any negative reviews, this one was worth the time and I am very critical of films."
tt7713068,"The Joker(Leto, not Phoenix) kicks out Harley(Robbie, showing more sides and dimension), in just the most recent of many cases of her trying to please guys who clearly aren't good for her. As such she no longer has his protection, and as it turns out a lot of people have grievances with her. They are frequently introduced in freeze-frame gags that are one of the numerous ways in which this is Suicide Squad if that movie was actually great, and not a mess, editing and tone wise. Other examples include the extensive use of music, which here is allowed to land and be effective, instead of almost immediately ending. As well as the story structure not being quite chronological in showing the events, now properly setting up who the different people are, and giving them depth. Black Canary(Smollett-Bell, an incredible performer, you seriously have to hear her cover of ""This Is A Man's World"" for yourself) sings in the club of Roman Sionis(McGregor, deliciously unpredictable as a cruel narcissist), but if pressed, she might be willing to admit that he does awful things. Renee Montoya(Perez) is an excellent cop who struggles to because of rotten coworkers. She believes that Huntress(Elizabeth Winstead, cool while also a hilarious Batman parody) is working for him, just like Victor Zsasz(Messina, sadistic, understands his master and knows how to deal with his outbursts) his right-hand man. Teenager Cassandra Cain just robbed him, not realising it would put a bullseye on her back. So the four women(who feel like they're each in their own film... and it's so good. Just. The very best) have to try to protect her, as every criminal in Gotham City tries to score by catching her."
tt7713068,"It's been 2 weeks and I'm still not fully sure how I feel about this film. On one hand, the film has incredible stunt and fight choreography, with most of the action being in-camera. However, aside from Harley Quinn, I never found myself on board with any of the characters and in some instances, was annoyed by them. I think there's a good film somewhere in here, but everything starts with a good script. And Birds of Prey definitely didn't have that."
tt7713068,"I got a weird impression from the trailer and kind of went in thinking I wouldn't like it, I don't know why I ever even doubted that I would love Harley! Maybe it's because I went in with low expectations, but I loved it!"
tt7713068,"After an animated backstory of Dr. Harleen Quinzel's journey to becoming Harley Quinn (narrated by the film's star, Margot Robbie, who provides voice-over throughout the film), she breaks up with the Joker as only Harley can: Ace Chemicals go BOOM. Not having thought this through, Harley finds she has no shortage of scumbags gunning for her who were only held at bay by her connection with Mr. J."
tt7713068,This low ratting is a bunch of bull. Because it's my favorite DC movie in awhile I love Black Mask crewing so much scenery he looks like he is about to eat the set and Harley as the narrator keeps the film from getting to dark. It does something feel like a Harley Quinn movie more than a Birds of Prey movie but they balance it out to be about 60 40
tt7713068,I dont understand why so hate? i like it more than suicide squad for real
tt7713068,"I loved Birds of Prey. It is Fantabulous ð It is brash, colourful, violent, silly, comic, and at the same time has pathos and is emancipating. Those women kick some serious arse! The music is fantastic. Let the whole thing wash over you and emerge grinning into the light. 10/10!"
tt7713068,It was so good I clapped at the end it's different funny the style of it is amazing so much better than suicide squad
tt7713068,"Birds Of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn) is a superhero film based on the DC Comics team of the same name and a sequel/spin-off to 2016's Suicide Squad. Starring Margot Robbie in the lead role as Harley Quinn, it is a fast-paced, violent, and sometimes disjointed follow-up with varying degrees of entertainment value."
tt7713068,"Simply awful.
From the acting, to the script, to the direction."
tt7713068,"I don't feel like this was some crazy man hating movie, or whatever you all are saying."
tt7713068,"Wasn't sure I wanted to watch this but I must say I'm glad I did, Margot Robbie is great as Harley Quinn as she was in the Suicide Squad and the other characters are also good. Not much of a storyline but a harmless fun film, give it a go"
tt7713068,"Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn is as ridiculous as it sounds, but Harley Quinn is quite the ridiculous character herself. For the most part, the DC Extended Universe has been largely hit or miss. Since its inception, it has always felt like an on-the-whim pop culture reaction to get on board with the way that other studios are heading. The DCEU has never felt like it simmered in long-term development and planning to create one cohesive ""extended universe"" across multiple films. That is one of the many reasons why, with eight films under its belt, it has not been met with critical success and box office records like the far more visionary and cohesive MCU. The once area where Warner/DC succeeded is in casting. Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman, Henry Cavill as Superman, and, yes, Margot Robbie as one Harley Quinn."
tt7713068,"After Suicide Squad split DC fans down the middle, one might've assumed that Harley Quinn's story in the DCEU was over. It wasn't."
tt7713068,Saw this with my 16 and 17 year old daughters who should be prime audience for this. They both pronounced it the worst superhero film they have ever seen.
tt7713068,The only good thing about this film is the existence and appearance of Harley Quinn herself or else the story is stupid + illogical and the other characters are also lame - Nothing great.
tt7713068,"""More women need to be nominated for awards"" Then stop coming up with garbage!"
tt7713068,"I thought that this was going to be Suicide Squad II but it turns out that it happens to be completely different. The main reason I thought that was because it was clear that Harley Quinn was the main character. Well, that is certainly true, but I also thought that she was also a member of the Birds of Prey, which happens to be another group of super heroes. Well, that turns out not to be the case either, which certainly shows you how much I know about the superhero worlds beyond what I see in the films."
tt7713068,"There is a ""car chase"" at about 25mph, a fight in a bouncy castle baseball bats v guns/knives. Disjointed narrative, McGregor is about as intimidating as cornflakes. It doesn't know who it's audience is. Mercifully short."
tt7713068,"Since skipping from seeing it at the cinema after finding Suicide Squad (2016-also reviewed) to be an utter mess, I've found The Suicide Squad (2020-also reviewed) and the Harleen graphic novel written and drawn by Stjepan Sejic to both be superb, I've been curious about catching up with this movie. Happily surprised to get this from my dad as a Christmas present, I got ready to see the birds fly."
tt7713068,Birds of Prey
tt7713068,"Perfectly executed IMAX thrill ride! A blast of exciting action, cinematography is beautiful, comedy is spot on, colors were so nice, and the stunts oh boy unbelievably well done. I'm so happy with the amount of character development involved a lot of movies don't heave enough of it Birds of Prey had plenty of letting the audience know as much info needed. I love the way everything plays out with so much style; very satisfying experience early into the year. Also my 790th review which is great!!"
tt7713068,"This movie failed on every level for me. The action scenes were somewhat decent, but the editing is on par with Suicide Squad at times. The story is told out of order, which would work if it had an interesting one. The portrayal of the characters was somewhat adequate, but the focus on Harley just showed how insecure this chick is about her career.
I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone with reasonable standards."
tt7713068,DONT LISTEN TO THOSE BAD REVIEWS. JUST WATCH IT. It's definitely worth to watch.
tt7713068,"Firstly, if you haven't seen this yet, but partied your way through the first ""Kick Arse"" movie, watch this ASAP."
tt7713068,"I really did enjoy this movie, it had a lot of heart and it was sincerely funny. The best performances were given by Margot Robbie and Ewan McGregor both seemed to genuinely encapsulate the idea of their character or rather the direction in which their characters were taken. Don't listen to the detractors. Go and see the film for yourself and make up your own mind on whether or not you like the film."
